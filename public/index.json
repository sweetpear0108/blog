Whatsmore, the choice is different in some fields by gender.\nOn the one hand, 68% of unemployed intent to do housework in morning, much higher than that in the afternoon, with only 28%. Shopping is another similar circumstance, 20% declined in the afternoon compare with 46% on first half of day. However, there is a exception, both men and women tend to watch TV in the afternoon, with 10% increasing along the day.\nOn the other hand, some arrangements are varied between men and women. 49% of women spent time on housework, while only 19% men interested in that. Opposite with housework, men showed more passion than women in gardening, 27% versus 5% in a whole day. At the same time, job hunting and sitting around have little difference in gender, separately within 6% and 3%.\nEvaluation: Task Achievement: 6.0 The candidate addresses the general topic of how unemployed people in the UK spent their time last year, distinguishing between activities preferred in the morning versus the afternoon and differences between gender. However, the response lacks overall clarity in presenting precise data comparison. Some statistical details mentioned do not relate directly to the task\u0026rsquo;s requirement to discuss the table effectively. The emphasis on time slots is appropriate, but a lack of clarity in summarizing and comparing critical data lowers the score.\nCoherence and Cohesion: 6.5 The structure of the essay shows a basic logical flow, distinguishing between morning activities and gender differences. However, the transitions between ideas are sometimes abrupt, and the linking phrases like \u0026ldquo;Whatsmore\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;On the one hand\u0026rdquo; are used awkwardly. The use of paragraphs is clear, but better cohesion could be achieved by smoother transitions and a clearer linkage between the data presented and the tasks outlined in the table.\nLexical Resource: 6.0 The use of vocabulary is adequate with terms like \u0026ldquo;intent\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;declined\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;varied\u0026rdquo; appropriately used. Some phrases and word choices are awkward or incorrect (\u0026ldquo;intent\u0026rdquo; should be \u0026ldquo;intend\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Whatsmore\u0026rdquo; is unconventional). There is a limited range of vocabulary to describe statistical data, and some repetition of words like \u0026ldquo;morning\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;afternoon\u0026rdquo; could be replaced with synonyms to enhance lexical range.\nGrammatical Range and Accuracy: 5.5 The response includes a mix of complex and simple sentences. There are several grammatical errors (\u0026ldquo;68% of unemployed intent to do housework\u0026rdquo; should be \u0026ldquo;intend\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;separately within 6% and 3%\u0026rdquo; is unclear and should be rephrased for clarity). These mistakes hinder the clarity and accuracy of the response. Punctuation is generally handled well, but sentence structure issues detract from the overall grammatical quality.\nOverall Remarks: The response provides a basic analysis of the table\u0026rsquo;s data concerning unemployed peoples\u0026rsquo; time utilization in the UK, categorized by time of day and gender differences. Although it captures fundamental distinctions, it struggles with clarity in data presentation and accuracy in language use. The essay would benefit from fewer grammatical errors, a better range of vocabulary concerning data description, and improved logical sequencing of ideas for higher coherence. The overall grade reflects these areas of strength and needed improvements.\nOverall Grade: 6.0\nAI润色 The table illustrates how unemployed individuals in the UK spent their time last year. Overall, people tend to engage in activities more frequently in the morning than in the afternoon, such as housework, shopping, and job hunting. Furthermore, there are gender differences in activity preferences.\nOn one hand, 68% of unemployed individuals prefer doing housework in the morning, a much higher percentage compared to the afternoon, which stands at only 28%. A similar pattern is observed for shopping, with a 20% decrease in the afternoon compared to 46% in the first half of the day. However, there is an exception as both men and women tend to watch TV more in the afternoon, with a 10% increase as the day progresses.\nOn the other hand, there are variations in activity choices between men and women. For instance, 49% of women spend time on housework, whereas only 19% of men are interested in this activity. In contrast, men show a greater interest in gardening compared to women, with 27% versus 5% spending time on this activity throughout the day. Additionally, there is little difference in gender when it comes to job hunting and leisure time, with only a 6% and 3% variance, respectively.\nbar The bar chart below shows estimated world illiteracy rates by region and by gender for the last year.\nSummarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.\nThe graph illustrates assessed world illiteracy ratio of the last year by region and by gender.\nAs the chart shows, the percentage of the male without literacy was generally fewer than the female. In addition, the illiteracy proportion varied from different regions, the south asia became the highest while developed countries was the least.\nThe illiterated female citizens surpassed half of the same gender population in south asia, for the male was over 30% as well. Arab states and sub-saharan africa showed similarity in the percentage as south asia, about 40 percent of overall people in average. However, residents in developed countries had a significant low ratio, reaching almost zero. As for the two regions left, the data was under 20%.\nWhatsmore, the women without literacy rates was 10% higher in most of regions compared to men, especially in sub-saharan africa, exceeding over one-fifth. While there were merely difference by gender in developed countries and latin american/caribbean.\nEvaluation: Task Achievement: 6.0 The candidate\u0026rsquo;s response addresses the illiteracy ratio by region and gender and provides a comparison between male and female rates in different areas. The overall analysis captures the essence of the data presented in the graph, but the response lacks specific numerical details and clearer summarization. While the key points are covered, more precision in discussing the data and its significance is needed for a higher score.\nCoherence and Cohesion: 6.5 The response demonstrates a logical organization, moving from general trends to specific data points. Transition phrases like \u0026ldquo;As the chart shows\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;In addition\u0026rdquo; help connect ideas. However, some abrupt transitions and repetitive language (\u0026ldquo;Illiterated female citizens\u0026rdquo;) could be refined for better coherence. The response effectively uses paragraphs and maintains a central theme but could enhance cohesion with smoother transitions.\nLexical Resource: 6.0 The candidate employs suitable vocabulary, with terms like \u0026ldquo;illiteracy proportion\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;exceeding over one-fifth\u0026rdquo; conveying meaning effectively. However, there are instances of awkward phrasing and inaccuracies (\u0026ldquo;illiterated\u0026rdquo; should be \u0026ldquo;illiterate\u0026rdquo;), impacting lexical quality. More variety in word choice and idiomatic expressions could enhance the lexical resource, along with improved spelling and form use.\nGrammatical Range and Accuracy: 5.5 The response exhibits a mix of simple and complex sentences, showcasing some grammatical variety. However, there are several errors in grammar and phrasing (\u0026ldquo;the percentage of the male without literacy was generally fewer than the female\u0026rdquo; could be improved for clarity). While punctuation is generally correct, enhancements in sentence structure and precise language use are needed for better accuracy.\nOverall Remarks: The response effectively presents the illiteracy ratio data by region and gender, highlighting the disparities between male and female rates in various regions. Though the general trends are conveyed, the analysis could benefit from clearer articulation of numerical details and improved language accuracy. Enhancing vocabulary variety, addressing grammatical errors, and refining coherence would elevate the overall quality of the response.\nOverall Grade: 6.0\nAI润色 The graph illustrates the assessed world illiteracy rates from the previous year, categorized by region and gender. As the chart indicates, the percentage of illiterate males was generally lower than that of females. Furthermore, the illiteracy rates varied across different regions, with South Asia exhibiting the highest figures, while developed countries reported the lowest.\nIn South Asia, the proportion of illiterate female citizens surpassed half of the female population, with illiteracy among males exceeding 30% as well. The Arab states and Sub-Saharan Africa displayed similar illiteracy rates, averaging around 40% for both genders. In contrast, residents of developed countries had a significantly low illiteracy rate, approaching nearly zero. The two remaining regions recorded illiteracy rates below 20%.\nMoreover, the illiteracy rate among women was 10% higher than that of men in most regions, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa, where it exceeded one-fifth. However, there was minimal difference in illiteracy rates by gender in developed countries and the Latin American/Caribbean region.\nOverall, the data highlights the persistent gender disparity in literacy rates, particularly in less developed areas.\npie The two pie charts below show the marital status of the populations of Canada and Australia.\nSummarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.\nThe two pie charts illustrate the marital status of the citizens of Canada and Australia.\nOverall, the \u0026lsquo;Separated but not divorced\u0026rsquo; and the \u0026lsquo;Married\u0026rsquo; status occupy over 80% of populations in both countries, having difference in propotion according to the nation though.\nAs for Canada, the Separated but not divorced stands at 53%, exceeding 12% compared to the data in Australia. There is 29% of Canadian residents who were married, which is significantly lower than the one in Australia (46%). Whereas the sum of the two reachs to 82% and 87% separately, including most of population in the country. What\u0026rsquo;s more, Same sex marriage is shown in Canada singlely, containing 3% of total people.\nConcerning single people, 7% in Canada and 5% in Australia, revealing similarity in this type. Same as the single, the widowed (7% versus 6%) or the divorced population (1% versus 2%) has only 1% difference in both counties as well.\nEvaluation Task Achievement: 6.5 The response addresses the prompt by comparing the marital status of citizens in Canada and Australia. It presents relevant data and highlights key differences in proportions, particularly regarding the \u0026ldquo;Separated but not divorced\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Married\u0026rdquo; categories. However, the analysis could be more comprehensive by providing clearer examples and a more detailed conclusion. While the main points are covered, the response lacks depth in discussing the implications of the statistics presented. Additionally, the mention of same-sex marriage in Canada is relevant but could be better integrated into the overall analysis. Overall, the response is focused on the topic but could benefit from a more thorough exploration of the data.\nCoherence and Cohesion: 6.0 The organization of ideas is generally logical, but the flow could be improved with clearer transitions between points. The use of cohesive devices is present but somewhat limited, leading to occasional abrupt shifts in topic. Paragraphing is not effectively utilized, as the response reads more like a continuous block of text rather than distinct sections. Each point could benefit from clearer topic sentences to guide the reader through the analysis. While the central theme is maintained, the lack of signposting language and varied sentence structures detracts from the overall coherence. More careful sequencing of ideas would enhance the clarity of the argument.\nLexical Resource: 6.5 The vocabulary used is appropriate, and there is a reasonable range of terms related to marital status. However, some phrases are repetitive, and the response could benefit from a broader use of synonyms to avoid redundancy. The candidate demonstrates an understanding of academic vocabulary, but there are instances where word choices could be more precise or varied. Although the language is generally clear, there are moments where idiomatic expressions or more sophisticated terms could enhance the overall quality. The spelling is mostly accurate, but the occasional awkward phrasing detracts from the overall impression.\nGrammatical Range and Accuracy: 6.0 The grammatical structures used in the response are mostly correct, with a mix of simple and complex sentences. However, there are a few grammatical errors, such as subject-verb agreement and punctuation issues, that affect the overall clarity. The candidate demonstrates an understanding of verb tenses, but there are instances of awkward phrasing that suggest a lack of fluency in more complex structures. While the response is generally understandable, the presence of minor errors indicates a need for further refinement in grammatical accuracy. More varied sentence structures would improve the overall quality and showcase a greater range of grammatical ability.\nOverall Grade: 6.0 The overall score reflects a balanced assessment of the candidate\u0026rsquo;s performance across all criteria. While the response demonstrates a good understanding of the task and presents relevant information, there are areas for improvement in coherence, vocabulary variety, and grammatical accuracy. A more structured approach and careful attention to detail would enhance the overall quality of the response.\nAI润色 The two pie charts illustrate the marital status of citizens in Canada and Australia. Overall, the categories of \u0026ldquo;Separated but not divorced\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Married\u0026rdquo; account for over 80% of the populations in both countries, although there are differences in proportions between the two nations.\nIn Canada, the percentage of individuals who are \u0026ldquo;Separated but not divorced\u0026rdquo; stands at 53%, which exceeds the corresponding figure in Australia by 12%. Meanwhile, 29% of Canadian residents are married, significantly lower than the 46% observed in Australia. The combined total of these two categories reaches 82% in Canada and 87% in Australia, representing a substantial portion of the population in each country. Additionally, same-sex marriage is uniquely represented in Canada, comprising 3% of the total population.\nRegarding single individuals, 7% of Canadians are single compared to 5% of Australians, indicating a similarity in this demographic. Similarly, the percentages of widowed individuals (7% in Canada versus 6% in Australia) and divorced individuals (1% in Canada versus 2% in Australia) show only a 1% difference between the two countries.\n动态图 line The graph below gives information about the percentage of the population in four Asian countries living in cities from 1970 to 2020, with predictions for 2030 and 2040.\nSummarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.\nThe line graph shows the percentage of people who live in cities in four Asian nations between 1970 and 2020, and predicts the data in 2030 and 2040.\nOverall, population in all four countires have increased more or few comparing with 50 years ago and the growing trend will be continued until 20 years later at least.\nIn 1970s, urban citizens in Thailand and Indonesia are under one fifth of total number, while the data are little bit higher in Philippines and Malaysia, around 30%. After 50 years development, population in cities of Malaysia have reached over 80%, which is the highest among the four. As Indonesia, which is the least one, raised rapidly over years and surpassed Philippines and Thailand after 2010.\nWith the prediction, the proportion of urban citizens will continuously increase after 2020, and Malaysia will keep it leading position. The urban population of all four countries will exceed a half amount in 2040.\nEvaluation: Task Achievement: 6.5 The candidate provides a clear overview of the line graph, addressing the main trends in urban population growth across four Asian nations from 1970 to 2020, along with predictions for 2030 and 2040. However, while the response mentions key data points, it lacks specific numerical details that would enhance the analysis. The statement about Malaysia having the highest urban population is accurate, but the comparison with Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand could be more explicitly detailed. Overall, the response captures the essence of the task but could benefit from more precise data references and a clearer summary of trends.\nCoherence and Cohesion: 6.0 The structure of the response is generally logical, with a clear progression from past data to future predictions. However, the use of cohesive devices is somewhat limited, and transitions between ideas could be smoother. Phrases like \u0026ldquo;In 1970s\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;After 50 years development\u0026rdquo; could be better integrated into the flow of the text. The candidate uses paragraphs effectively, but clearer signposting would improve the overall coherence of the response.\nLexical Resource: 6.5 The vocabulary used is appropriate for the task, with terms like \u0026ldquo;urban citizens,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;population,\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;predictions\u0026rdquo; effectively conveying the intended meaning. However, there are instances of awkward phrasing, such as \u0026ldquo;under one fifth of total number\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;little bit higher,\u0026rdquo; which detract from the overall quality. The candidate demonstrates a reasonable range of vocabulary but could enhance their lexical resource by incorporating more varied expressions and avoiding repetition.\nGrammatical Range and Accuracy: 6.0 The response includes a mix of simple and complex sentences, demonstrating a fair range of grammatical structures. However, there are several grammatical errors, such as \u0026ldquo;the population in all four countries have increased more or few\u0026rdquo; (should be \u0026ldquo;more or less\u0026rdquo;) and \u0026ldquo;the data are little bit higher\u0026rdquo; (should be \u0026ldquo;a little bit higher\u0026rdquo;). These errors affect clarity and accuracy. Punctuation is generally correct, but some sentences could be restructured for better grammatical precision.\nOverall Remarks: The response effectively summarizes the trends in urban population growth in four Asian nations, providing a clear overview of the data presented in the line graph. While it captures the main points, the analysis would benefit from more specific numerical references, improved cohesion, and greater grammatical accuracy. The overall grade reflects these strengths and areas for improvement.\nOverall Grade: 6.0\nAI润色 The line graph illustrates the percentage of urban residents in four Asian nations from 1970 to 2020, with projections for 2030 and 2040.\nOverall, the urban population has increased in all four countries compared to 50 years ago, and this upward trend is expected to continue for at least the next 20 years.\nIn the 1970s, the proportion of urban dwellers in Thailand and Indonesia was less than one-fifth of the total population, slightly higher in the Philippines and Malaysia at around 30%. Over the 50-year period, Malaysia\u0026rsquo;s urban population surged to over 80%, the highest among the four countries. Indonesia, initially the lowest, experienced rapid growth and surpassed the Philippines and Thailand after 2010.\nLooking ahead, the percentage of urban residents is projected to keep rising after 2020, with Malaysia maintaining its leading position. By 2040, the urban population in all four nations is anticipated to exceed half of the total population.\n流程图 The diagram below shows how glass is recycled.\nSummarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.\nThe flow chart depicts the recycled process of glass.\nConsumers always buy drinks from supermarket, the useless glass bottle is disposed to the recycle bin at most of time. The recycled litter would be collected and sent to treatment plant by specified staff in a period. Washing and sterilising process would apply on the first step, in order to strip down the dirt and other harmful stuff in the bottle.\nThe glass will be crushed into pieces then through into melting machine. The high temperature will reshape the bottle into liquad glass and kill all bectiria remained. Then there is regeneration step, the raw material will be moulded into different shape depends on the accomodation. In final, the goods with glass container will be delivered to the supermarket for selling.\nThe 6 graph in flow chart illustrates the life of the recycled glass bottle, reborn times by times for the sake of these professional and effective processes.\nEvaluation: Task Achievement: 5.5 The response describes the process of glass recycling and the steps involved in transforming glass bottles back into new products. However, there are some inaccuracies and missing details in the explanation, such as the specific temperature of the melting machine, the duration of each step, and the environmental impact of the process. The response partially addresses the prompt but lacks comprehensive details and precision. Coherence and Cohesion: 6.0 The flow of ideas is somewhat logical, with a clear progression from the initial disposal of glass bottles to the final product delivery. However, there are instances of unclear sequencing and abrupt transitions between steps. The transition phrases are limited, and the organization could be improved for better coherence and cohesion.\nLexical Resource: 5.5 The vocabulary used is basic and lacks variety in describing the recycling process. The terminology related to recycling, such as \u0026ldquo;washing and sterilizing,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;melting machine,\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;regeneration step,\u0026rdquo; is employed, but there is a lack of sophisticated vocabulary and technical terms that would enhance the explanation. More precise and specific language related to the recycling industry would improve the lexical resource.\nGrammatical Range and Accuracy: 5.0 The response contains a mix of simple and complex sentence structures but is marred by several grammatical errors and inaccuracies. Phrases like \u0026ldquo;reshape the bottle into liquad glass\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;kill all bectiria remained\u0026rdquo; contain spelling and grammatical mistakes. Additionally, some sentences lack clarity and coherence, affecting the overall grammatical quality of the response.\nOverall Remarks: The response describes the glass recycling process but lacks depth and accuracy in explaining the steps involved. To enhance the quality of the explanation, the candidate should provide more specific details, correct the grammatical errors, and use a wider range of vocabulary related to recycling technology. Improving coherence, precision, and vocabulary use would significantly elevate the overall quality of the response.\nOverall Grade: 5.5\nAI润色 This flow chart illustrates the recycling process of glass.\nConsumers typically purchase beverages from supermarkets, and the empty glass bottles are usually discarded in recycling bins. The collected glass waste is then transported to a treatment plant by designated personnel. The initial steps involve washing and sterilizing the glass to remove dirt and other contaminants.\nSubsequently, the glass is crushed into pieces and fed into a melting machine where high temperatures melt the glass into a liquid state, effectively eliminating any remaining bacteria. The next phase involves the regeneration process, where the molten glass is molded into various shapes as per requirements. Finally, the glass products, including containers, are packaged and delivered to supermarkets for sale.\nThe flow chart outlines a cyclical process of glass recycling, highlighting the repeated cycles of rebirth for glass bottles through these efficient and specialized procedures.\n地图 The two maps below show the changes that have taken place in the town of Westley since 1815.\nSummarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.\nThe two graphs depict the changes in the town of Westley from 1815.\nIn the past, there was a bridge named \u0026lsquo;Twine Toll Bridge\u0026rsquo; in the eastnorthen of the town acrossing the river, providing the only way to London. Along the winding road, there was a church in the central of the town, which beside it is the Lenton Woods. Residential area was settled in the south of the woods, including Market Square, Town hall and Houses. At the end of the road located the fields.\nA significant change have taken place in the last hundreds of years. A railway have built in the eastern, acrossing the fields before and replacing the old bridge, which connects Westley to other place. Lenton Housing Estate is located in the place where the Woods before. Whatsmore, the road is extended to northen area with a train station in the corner.\nOverall, Westley has advanced a lot with more modern facilities than the old time.\nEvaluation: Task Achievement: 6.5 The candidate effectively describes the changes in the town of Westley from 1815 using the provided information. The response covers the historical presence of \u0026lsquo;Twine Toll Bridge,\u0026rsquo; the church, Lenton Woods, and the residential area accurately. The mention of the railway development and subsequent changes in the eastern region provides a clear depiction of the town\u0026rsquo;s evolution. The focus on significant alterations over time demonstrates an understanding of the data presented in the two graphs. However, providing more specific details about the town\u0026rsquo;s transformation and emphasizing key historical landmarks could enhance the task achievement score. Coherence and Cohesion: 6.5 The response features a logical and coherent structure, outlining the town\u0026rsquo;s changes in chronological order. Transition phrases like \u0026lsquo;In the past\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;A significant change\u0026rsquo; help connect different time periods and developments. While the progression is clear, some abrupt transitions could be smoothened for better coherence. The central theme of urban development and modernization is maintained throughout the response.\nLexical Resource: 6.0 The vocabulary usage in the response is adequate, with terms like \u0026lsquo;Lenton Housing Estate\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;Market Square\u0026rsquo; effectively describing the town\u0026rsquo;s features. However, there are instances of repetitive language and a lack of variety in vocabulary, such as repeatedly using \u0026rsquo;eastern\u0026rsquo; and \u0026rsquo;northen. More diverse word choices and greater precision in describing historical landmarks could improve the lexical resource.\nGrammatical Range and Accuracy: 6.0 The candidate demonstrates a mix of simple and complex sentence structures, providing a clear description of the town\u0026rsquo;s transformation. While grammatical errors are minimal, some sentences could be refined for better accuracy and clarity. Improvements in sentence structure and word order could enhance the response\u0026rsquo;s overall quality.\nOverall Remarks: The response effectively depicts the changes in the town of Westley over time, capturing key developments from 1815 to modern days. The historical evolution of landmarks like the bridge and church, along with the introduction of the railway and modern facilities, is well articulated. Enhancements in vocabulary variety, smoother transitions between ideas, and increased precision in language use would elevate the response.\nOverall Grade: 6.0\nAI润色 The two graphs depict the changes in the town of Westley from 1815. In the past, a bridge named \u0026lsquo;Twine Toll Bridge\u0026rsquo; was situated in the northeastern part of the town, crossing the river and serving as the primary route to London. Along the winding road, there stood a church at the town\u0026rsquo;s center, adjacent to Lenton Woods. The residential area was established to the south of the woods, comprising Market Square, the Town Hall, and residential houses, with fields marking the end of the road.\nSignificant changes have taken place over the past centuries. A railway was constructed in the east, crossing the fields and replacing the old bridge, providing a new connection for Westley to other areas. Lenton Housing Estate now occupies the former location of the woods. Additionally, the road has been extended to the northern area, featuring a train station at the corner.\nOverall, Westley has undergone substantial development, introducing more modern facilities compared to its earlier days.\nThe plans below show a harbour in 2000 and how it looks today.\nSummarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.\nThe graphs depict the change of Porth Harbour between 2000 and today.\nAs the first map shown, the main road constructed in the west of the harbour. Car parks and toilets were right beside the road. At the end of the road which branched from the main road in southern, was the lifeboal which is located in front of the public beach. A disused castle was left in the southeastern corner. The dock is on northern of the sea, with the passenger ferries in the water.\nNowadays, A private yachis named \u0026lsquo;Marina\u0026rsquo; in the southwest of the coast replaces the fishing boats before. Additionally, an extra showers and toilets are built on the left hand of it. The new building on the right hand of Marina is Cafes and shops. What\u0026rsquo;s more, a hotle is settled instead of the disposed castle, changing the beach aside it to private use for guest.\nOverall, the harbour has few changes in decades as a result of the development of tourism.\nTask Achievement: 5.0 The response addresses the prompt by describing the changes in Porth Harbour from 2000 to the present. However, it lacks depth in presenting a clear position or viewpoint. The details provided are somewhat relevant but could benefit from a more structured approach to highlighting significant changes. The description of the harbour\u0026rsquo;s features is somewhat vague and lacks specific examples that would enhance the analysis. Additionally, the conclusion is weak, failing to effectively summarize the key points or provide insight into the implications of these changes. Overall, while the task is addressed, the response could be more comprehensive and focused to achieve a higher score.\nCoherence and Cohesion: 5.5 The organization of ideas is somewhat logical, but there are issues with coherence. The transition between different features of the harbour is abrupt, which can confuse the reader. While some cohesive devices are used, they are not consistently applied, leading to a lack of fluidity in the writing. The response could benefit from clearer topic sentences and signposting language to guide the reader through the various changes. Additionally, the sequencing of ideas could be improved to create a more cohesive narrative. Overall, while there is a basic structure, the response lacks the necessary coherence to achieve a higher score.\nLexical Resource: 5.5 The vocabulary used in the response is adequate but lacks variety and precision. There are instances of repetitive language, which detracts from the overall quality of the writing. Some phrases, such as \u0026ldquo;extra showers and toilets,\u0026rdquo; could be expressed more elegantly to enhance clarity. While there is an attempt to use relevant terms related to the topic, the lack of synonyms and paraphrasing limits the lexical range. Additionally, there are occasional spelling errors, such as \u0026ldquo;hotle,\u0026rdquo; which further undermine the quality of the vocabulary. Overall, while the lexical resource is functional, it could be significantly improved with a broader range of vocabulary and more precise language.\nGrammatical Range and Accuracy: 5.0 The grammatical structures used in the response are generally correct, but there are several errors that affect clarity. For instance, phrases like \u0026ldquo;the lifeboal which is located\u0026rdquo; contain spelling mistakes that detract from the overall quality. Additionally, there are issues with sentence structure, as some sentences are overly simplistic or lack complexity. The use of verb tenses is mostly appropriate, but there are instances where the tense shifts create confusion. Punctuation is generally correct, but the writing could benefit from more varied sentence structures to enhance grammatical range. Overall, while the response demonstrates a basic understanding of grammar, the errors present hinder its effectiveness.\nOverall Grade: 5.0 The average of the scores across all criteria results in an overall grade of 5.0. The response addresses the task but lacks depth and clarity in several areas. Improvements in coherence, vocabulary variety, and grammatical accuracy could elevate the score significantly. The writing demonstrates potential but requires more careful organization and attention to detail to achieve a higher band score.\nAI润色 The graphs illustrate the changes at Porth Harbour between 2000 and today. In the first map, a main road was constructed in the west of the harbour, with car parks and toilets located right beside it. At the end of the road, which branches off from the main road to the south, lies the lifeboat station situated in front of the public beach. A disused castle remains in the southeastern corner, while the dock is located to the north of the sea, accommodating passenger ferries.\nIn the present day, a private yacht marina has replaced the former fishing boats in the southwest of the coast. Additionally, extra showers and toilets have been built to the left of the marina. On the right side, new cafes and shops have been established. Furthermore, a hotel has been constructed in place of the abandoned castle, converting the adjacent beach into a private area for guests.\nOverall, the harbour has undergone a few changes over the decades, primarily due to the development of tourism.\n两张图 The line graph and pie chart below show information on crime in the UK for the last year.\nSummarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.\nThe line chart and pie graph illustrate the relation between age and crime and types of crime in the UK last year separately.\nAs the line chart shows, there was a difference in crime rate varies from ages. Concerning children who were under 8 years old, there was no crime happend regarding the innocence in this age. The percentage surged up to 80% when crime age reached 20. Then the rates decreased according to the age, entering stable stage (below 20%) after age 28.\nThe pie chart catagorized crime into four types: violent, property, drug, and public order. Violent crime stood at the leading position, with 46% of total count. While public order type only occupied 9%. The remaining two types were over 10% higher than the former one, reaching about one-fifth separately.\nOverall, the crime rate stayed at high level during the young age, prioring in the violent commitment.\ntask 2 观点（二选一） The most important aim of science should be to improve people\u0026rsquo;s lives.\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?\nThere is a statement claim that we should view improving people\u0026rsquo;s lives as the most important aim of science. I strongly agree with it for three aspects in economy, ethical problem and feasibility.\nFirst of all, enonomy influences both our lives and science. Over last a hundred year, human society evoluted rapidly with the assistance of science, which brings a numerous amount of fortunes to all people in the world. As the result, with the substaintial money created with high productivity, scientist have a better condition for research, which can be help them to make a further step in science.\nBesides, ethical issues should be took into consideration. Science is a double sword, if we can not estimate the influence, it will bring disaster to human. As we all know, the initial usage of bomb is for road creating through mountains. Unfortunately, it becomes a killer in war with the abuse using, brings millions of death and sorrow for family. So we must keep \u0026lsquo;improving human\u0026rsquo;s lives\u0026rsquo; as the main aim of science.\nSome people may think we should develop science as fast as we can no matter what. However, take the one under control and keep the aim on benefiting human is a more feasible way. We can gather strength and motivation effectively under a clear direction, just like driving on the express way.\nIn short, I believe the first and foremost aim of science is to benefit people. We should take science as an assistant for us rather than serving it. Science without people is nothing.\nEvaluation: Task Achievement: 6.5 The candidate strongly agrees with the statement regarding the importance of improving people\u0026rsquo;s lives as the primary goal of science. The response addresses the three aspects of economy, ethical issues, and feasibility to support this viewpoint. The candidate effectively presents a clear position and develops ideas coherently and logically. Relevant examples and evidence are provided to strengthen the argument. However, some parts of the response could be more refined to fully answer the question and avoid repetition. While the conclusion is effective, a more comprehensive analysis of the statement\u0026rsquo;s implications would enhance the score.\nCoherence and Cohesion: 6.5 The response is structured logically, with a clear introduction, body, and conclusion discussing the various aspects of the statement. Transition phrases like \u0026ldquo;First of all,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Besides,\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;In short\u0026rdquo; help guide the reader through the argument. The paragraphs are well-organized, but some sentences could be more succinct for better cohesion. Maintaining the central theme and ensuring each paragraph has a clear topic sentence would strengthen coherence.\nLexical Resource: 6.0 The vocabulary used is generally appropriate, with terms like \u0026ldquo;fortunes,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;feasibility,\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;substantial money\u0026rdquo; effectively conveying the candidate\u0026rsquo;s ideas. However, there are instances of awkward phrasing (\u0026ldquo;evoluted rapidly\u0026rdquo;) and grammatical errors that impact the lexical quality. More precise and accurate vocabulary choices could enhance the overall lexical resource, along with increased variety and idiomatic expressions.\nGrammatical Range and Accuracy: 5.5 The response includes a mix of simple and complex sentence structures, demonstrating an attempt at grammatical variety. However, there are several grammatical errors throughout the response, such as \u0026ldquo;enonomy\u0026rdquo; (economy), \u0026ldquo;substaintial\u0026rdquo; (substantial), and \u0026ldquo;be took\u0026rdquo; (be taken), affecting clarity and accuracy. Punctuation use is adequate, but improvements in sentence structure and grammatical precision are needed for a higher score.\nOverall Remarks: The response effectively argues for considering the improvement of people\u0026rsquo;s lives as the central aim of science, with supporting points related to economy, ethics, and feasibility. While the response is well-structured and coherent, there are areas for improvement in the clarity and accuracy of language use, as well as grammatical precision. Enhancing vocabulary range and addressing grammatical errors would elevate the overall quality of the response.\nOverall Grade: 6.0\nAI润色 There is a statement that we should view improving people\u0026rsquo;s lives as the most important aim of science. I strongly agree with this for three reasons: economic impact, ethical considerations, and feasibility.\nFirst of all, the economy significantly influences both our lives and the field of science. Over the last hundred years, human society has evolved rapidly with the assistance of scientific advancements, generating substantial wealth for people worldwide. As a result, with the substantial financial resources created through high productivity, scientists have better conditions for research, enabling them to make further advancements in their fields.\nFurthermore, ethical issues must be taken into consideration. Science is a double-edged sword; if we cannot assess its consequences, it can lead to disastrous outcomes for humanity. For instance, the original purpose of explosives was to facilitate road construction through mountains. Unfortunately, these same explosives have been weaponized in warfare, leading to millions of deaths and immense sorrow for countless families. Therefore, we must prioritize \u0026ldquo;improving human lives\u0026rdquo; as the primary aim of science.\nSome may argue that we should advance science as rapidly as possible, regardless of the consequences. However, maintaining control and focusing on benefiting humanity is a more feasible approach. With a clear direction, we can effectively harness our collective strength and motivation, much like driving on a well-maintained expressway.\nIn conclusion, I believe the foremost aim of science should be to benefit people. We should view science as an ally rather than something to be served. After all, science without humanity is meaningless.\nThe working week should be shorter and workers should have a longer weekend.\nDo you agree or disagree?\nThere is an arguement about the days of the working week and the weekend. I strongly agree with the view that the working time should be shorter and more weekend time should be left to workers. It can be discussed in 3 reasons: working efficiency, mental health of workers, and economy influency.\nHaving more relax time would increase the efficiency in working. The weekend is not only a time for entertainment, but also a chance to have a rest. As we known, individuals should be 100% concentrated and devoted into work from Monday to Friday, which is a really tough thing. As a research, efficiency falls rapidly after 45 minutes focusing, showing that a break is nessesary. Same with working, having a good rest in weekend will benifit the efficiency of the workers, a longer weekend will definetly impact it.\nIndividuals mental health is another issue. A dull life without relaxing can cause the mental disease occasionally. As a human, we have feelings, which is complex and needs a way to regulate by outselves. A relax would be the best medicine with no doubt.\nSome persons may think a shorter working time would bring side effect to the economy. However, people would do other things in the weekend as well, such as visiting museum, watching movie, shopping and so on. All of things would encourage the grown of the economy.\nIn conclusion, a shorter working week will benifits both society and individual.\nEvaluation Task Achievement: 6.5 The response adequately addresses the argument about reducing working hours and increasing weekend time for workers. The candidate clearly states agreement with the view and supports this with three reasons: working efficiency, mental health, and economic influence. Each aspect is discussed to some degree, but the support could be strengthened with more detailed evidence or data, particularly in areas like efficiency and economic impact. The response touches on relevant points but would benefit from deeper analysis and stronger conclusions drawn from more concrete examples or statistics to thoroughly answer the prompt and fully cover all parts of the task.\nCoherence and Cohesion: 6.0 The essay is structured with a clear introduction, body paragraphs for each argument, and a conclusion, which aids in maintaining a coherent flow of ideas. However, transitions between ideas feel somewhat abrupt at times, and the linkage between the main thesis and supporting points could be smoother. The use of cohesive devices like \u0026ldquo;however\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;as a result\u0026rdquo; is appropriate but limited. More varied and effective use of these devices could enhance the logical flow of the essay and help better connect the points to the overall argument.\nLexical Resource: 6.0 The vocabulary is generally appropriate, with specific terms like \u0026ldquo;efficiency,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;mental health,\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;economic influence\u0026rdquo; adequately used. However, the lexical range is somewhat limited, and there are instances of awkward or incorrect word choices (\u0026ldquo;grown\u0026rdquo; instead of \u0026ldquo;growth,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;benifit\u0026rdquo; instead of \u0026ldquo;benefit\u0026rdquo;). Expanding the vocabulary with more precise and varied language would strengthen the essay. Moreover, the candidate should focus on accurate spelling and correct use of words to improve the lexical resource score.\nGrammatical Range and Accuracy: 5.5 The grammatical range is somewhat limited, primarily consisting of simple and some compound structures. While the response includes attempts at complex sentences, there are frequent grammatical errors that impede clarity, such as issues with verb forms (\u0026ldquo;benifits\u0026rdquo; should be \u0026ldquo;benefits\u0026rdquo;), and preposition use. Improving sentence variety and correcting grammatical mistakes would enhance the clarity and sophistication of the essay.\nOverall Remarks: The response presents a clear argument in favor of more weekend time and shorter working weeks, with reasons centered around efficiency, mental health, and economic benefits. While the ideas are relevant and the structure is clear, the execution could be improved with better cohesion, a richer lexical resource, and more accurate grammar. Enhancements in these areas would provide a stronger, more compelling argument.\nOverall Grade: 6.0 This grade reflects an essay that meets the basic requirements of the task with some coherence and relevance but needs improvements in detail, lexical range, and grammatical accuracy to achieve a higher score.\nAI润色 There is an argument about the days of the working week and the weekend. I strongly agree with the view that the working time should be shorter and more weekend time should be allocated to workers. This can be discussed for three reasons: working efficiency, workers\u0026rsquo; mental health, and its impact on the economy. Having more relaxation time would increase efficiency at work. The weekend is not just for entertainment but also a crucial time for rest. It is well-known that individuals need to be fully concentrated and dedicated to work from Monday to Friday, which can be challenging. Research shows that efficiency declines rapidly after 45 minutes of focusing, highlighting the necessity of breaks. Similarly, having a good rest on the weekend would benefit workers\u0026rsquo; efficiency, and a longer weekend would certainly have a positive impact.\nMental health is another critical aspect. A monotonous life without relaxation can lead to mental health issues. Being human, we have complex emotions that need self-regulation. Relaxation is indeed the best medicine for maintaining mental well-being.\nSome individuals may believe that a shorter working week could have negative effects on the economy. However, people engage in various activities over the weekend, such as visiting museums, watching movies, and shopping. All of these activities contribute to the growth of the economy.\nIn conclusion, a shorter working week would benefit both society and individuals.\nproblem and solution Some species of animals are almost extinct; and many others seem to be fast approaching a similar risk. What are the reasons for this? What should be done to solve this problem?\nGive reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge and experience.\nSome of the animals are endangered nowadays, while many others are facing ectinction. There are many reasons, such as the human activity, climate change, and the flaw of genes. People should take actions to eliminate the aggravation of this problem. On the one hand, humanity intrusion is one of the biggest factor of the extinction. Many forests were cut off due to the either the living requirement or the economy profits. For instance, the amazon rainforest is demolished in the significant speed every year, bringing disaster for the species living in it. The quantity of the specie is decline for this issue which leads to the extinction. Besides, the climate change is another important cause. As the temperature increase, the water becomes warm than before which would affect the original residents like turtles or sharks in the sea. Some fishes relocate to new place where more suitable for the living, which brings a lack of food resources for the species preying them. Although humanity can not revert the climate change trend, which is a nature regulation, they can slow the process down in some extend by controlling the generation fo carbon-dioxide, eliminating the pollution, conserving the habitat and so on. The relative division should formulate the management to keep the original habitat staying away from the abusing use of company or government. Overall, protect animals is the responsibility of each individual. We should contribute as much as we can to prevent some species going to extinction. Animals are the priceless treasure of the earth.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:40585/posts/iltes/%E9%9B%85%E6%80%9D%E5%86%99%E4%BD%9C/","summary":"初稿、ai评分、ai润色","title":"雅思写作练习记录"},{"content":"听力 对话中的逻辑词\n留意but、so、another、particularly等强调词，后边的很大可能是重点 技巧\n同义替换、出现原词可能是陷阱 new xxx 意味着可能有old 逻辑词、连接词 按题号顺序答题 填空题 注意几个word，有没有number 至少看空格前一个词，猜词性 看特色词（忽略重复出现的词）、专有名词、介词、数字等方便定位 看段落符号，确定逻辑关系（通过对话中连接词进行定位） 标题、小标题 地图题 方位 已知地点（图中和题目） 常识性标注（看画、小记号） 扫一遍字母 配对题 竖向比较 阅读 如何读得快：\n关键词 不要一个一个词读，一个块一起看 读不懂的读快，读得懂的认真读 逻辑词：\n转折：后边重点 并列：定位 因果 举例子：前边观点 填空题定位方法：\n同义替换 并列关系 因果关系 转折关系 主被动改写 词性 冠词、数字 从句 介绍专有名词时 判断题几种情况： True:\n同义替换 根据几句话总结 False:\n同义替换+意思相反 Not Given\n内容未提及（特例：题目中提到most、more之类的比较级，但原文并没有，也是） 提到内容，但其逻辑关系未提及 平行阅读法 适用范围：匹配题和顺序题同时出现时（一般passage2）\n定位填空题开始位置（找定位词，找不到要记住），通读文章，随读随做段落匹配，发现填空题就做并看下一个待做题。\n判断题可以看两个，避免ng\n写作 小作文 三种：图表、流程图、地图\n图表 动态图 vs 静态图\n侧重点：动态图体现趋势（change），静态图体现对比（difference） 指令：summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.\n选择 select 描述 report 比较 compare 总体思路 通过作比较**选择出相对应的数据，基于此进行描述\n哪几方面作比较： 数值：最大值 最小值 等值 差值 倍数 大于 小于 趋势：上升 下降 波动 稳定 （只存在于动态图） 幅度：剧烈 平缓 作文结构：四段式 第一段：改写题目中的图表描述（1-2句）\n某种图shows某种数据在某种条件下\n改写三种方法：换词、换位置、概括\nbetween 19xx and 20xx ==\u0026gt; over a period of xx years 第二段：宏观概述（2-3句）\n看整体形状，动态图\u0026ndash;趋势，静态图\u0026ndash;差异 第三段：细节描述（4-5句）\n第四段：细节描述（4-5句）\n分组描述：时间、排名、自身特点、比较维度、图表数量 细节段引导词 两种不同数据：As for x, Concerning X\n相似/相反：similarly, likewise / by comparison, by contrast, on the other hand\n两张图表：as shown in the first/second chart\n逻辑连接词 并列：in addition, moreover, furthermore\n类比：similarly, likewise\n转折、对比：while, whereas, on the otherhand, by contrast, on the contrary, but, however\n描述技巧 从xxx到xxx一直是递增的\n完成进行时: have been doing till xxx (by now). （时态根据到xxx的时间） 主辅结合，一句话描述两三个数据要点\n内容组合： 前后结合（两段趋势）、文理结合（对数据的概括，避免主观）、动静结合（数据+趋势）、宏微结合（微观描述宏观比较）\n流程图 按步骤描述\n主要分类：工序流程图、生物生长过程图\n语态：\n工序：被动语态，一般现在时 生长：主动语态，一般现在时 作文结构：四段式 第一段：改写题目中的图表描述（1-2句）\n第二段：前一半流程描述（5-6句）\n第三段：后一半流程描述（5-6句）\n第四段：概述（1-2句）\n概括流程的步骤数量和概况 描述技巧 图形整体+细节\n补充文字+数字\n主辅结合：first 对A的描述, followed immediately by 对步骤B的描述\n逻辑连接词 initially, the following stage, enterting the final phase\n地图 主要分类：选址、变化\n关键词 绝对位置（东南西北）east west south north 相对位置（临近、对侧、环绕）adjacent,opposite,surround 区域的形状（长方形、三角形、L型）rectangle,triangle,L-shaped 道路的形态（直接转弯、蜿蜒曲折）direct sharp turn, winding 使用状态（使用中、废弃）in use, abandoned 植被（覆盖、空空如也）covered, barren 设施建设（建立、拆除）establish, demolish 建筑改造（扩建、缩小、移位）expand,reduce,relocate 变化类地图作文结构 第一段：改写题目中的图表描述（1-2句）\n第二段：变化前\n第三段：变化后\n按照图中丰富程度确定二三段句数 尺度描述 遵循一定顺序描述（ex.从入口由西向东） 第四段：总结（1-2句）\n概括流程的步骤数量和概况 大作文 评分 观点、逻辑、用词、语法\n分类 观点型（1-4）、分析型（5）、混搭型（6）\nDo you think this is a positive or negative development? 认为话题中的社会现象是一个好的发展趋势还是坏的发展趋势？\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree? 你在多大程度上同意、不同意话题中的观点？\nSome people think.. other people think\u0026hellip; Discuss both view and give your own opinion. 讨论话题中的两个观点，并给出自己的观点\nDo you think the advantages of this trend outweigh the disadvantages? 你认为话题中的社会现象的优点是否超过或大于他的缺点？\nWhy What How Why has this happened?\nWhat can be done to deal with this?\n针对这种社会现象，他的原因\\结果是什么？他的解决方案又是什么?\nWhat are the reasons and consequences of this trend?\n这种社会现象的原因和影响分别是什么？ 混搭 why what how + your view 时间分配 10 min 构思\n5 + 10 + 5 min 写作\n如何构思 brainstorm 写下能想到的任何观点 develop ideas in detail keep asking \u0026lsquo;why\u0026rsquo;? 想能够支撑观点的例子 归纳分组观点（编号） 观点型题目（Discuss both view）行文结构 (四段式) Introduction 转述题目 + 观点 People have different views about (opinion 1,2).

在PostgreSQL中，即使在选择相关列上存在索引，查询计划也可能选择顺序扫描（Sequential Scan）而不是索引扫描（Index Scan）。这是因为查询优化器需要基于多种因素做出决策，如预计的查询代价，表大小，数据的分布等。以下是一些可能的原因：\n全表扫描优于索引扫描：倘若你要查询的数据占据了表的大部分，顺序扫描可能更有效。PostgreSQL查询优化器会权衡全表扫描和索引扫描的代价，如果全表扫描的预计代价更低，那么它可能会选择全表扫描。\n统计信息不准确：PostgreSQL的查询优化器基于统计信息对查询计划进行优化。如果表的统计信息不准确（例如，表数据已经发生了大幅度变化但是没有重新收集统计信息），查询优化器可能会做出错误的决策，即使索引扫描更高效，也可能选择顺序扫描。\n索引列的选择性不高：如果索引列的值重复度很高（例如，性别、是否启用等值只有几种的列），那么使用索引扫描的效率可能并不高，查询优化器可能会选择顺序扫描。\n系统参数设置的问题：某些PostgreSQL系统参数可能影响到索引的使用，比如enable_seqscan参数控制了是否优先使用顺序扫描。\n如果你注意到了查询计划中一直使用序列扫描而不是索引扫描，且索引扫描明显更高效，你可能需要重新收集统计信息（使用ANALYZE命令），或者检查你的查询是否能够有效的利用索引，或者审查并调整相关的系统参数。\n逐一排查 全表扫描优于索引扫描？不确定。全表10亿条数据，全表扫描会比索引扫描更高效么？\n统计信息不准确？不确定。\n索引列的选择性不高？不太可能🙅。ts是按照观看时间排序的，不存在重复度很高的情况。\n系统参数设置的问题？不太可能🙅。任务正常运行一段时间了。\nps：EXPLAIN中cost代表查询优化器估算的查询代价，原因一关于全表扫描和索引扫描的取舍就取决于优化器对两种扫描方式的代价估算，而估算则需要参考原因二提到的统计信息，也就是说一二是相关的。\n有索引但不走的情况有哪些？ 表很小（100行以内），顺序扫描的效率可能会高于索引扫描。\n返回结果占总表很大比例。\n当LIMIT数量很小时，优化器可能会认为“顺序扫描直到结果达到限制数量后终止”会更快的找到结果；但这是双刃剑，依赖于表统计数据的准确性。\n优化器参考的统计信息有哪些？ 表的大小：一般来说，对于非常小的表，顺序扫描往往更有效，因为索引扫描涉及到查找索引并获取磁盘上数据的过程，这对于小表来说可能比直接顺序扫描更耗时。相反，对于大表，索引扫描往往能显著提高效率。\n索引的选择性：索引的选择性是指通过索引能够区分的记录的百分比。如果索引的选择性较高（例如，主键索引），邐那么索引扫描往往更有效。\n查询的选择度：如果查询过滤大部分数据，那么索引扫描对于性能的提升更明显。因为顺序扫描需要扫描整个表，而索引扫描只需要访问满足条件的索引项和相关记录。\n硬件性能：硬件的 IO 性能和 CPU 性能也会影响扫描方式的选择。IO 密集的工作负载可能更适合使用索引扫描，而 CPU 密集的工作负载可能更适合使用顺序扫描。\n索引和表的物理顺序：如果表的物理顺序与索引的顺序高度相关（correlation 接近 1），那么使用索引扫描的成本可能降低，因为顺序 IO 往往比随机 IO 更高效。\n问题定位 通过排查可以猜测：是优化器在执行查询命令时，对代价估算出现了错误，导致选择了实际性能更差的全表扫描方法。\n横向对比其他表 除了history表之外，数据库中还有两个结构相似、数据量相似、索引设置相似的记录表history_a,history_b（简称a表b表），其中a表和history一样在执行后台删除任务，b表没有执行过删除任务。\n浅看一眼表内总行数：\nx=\u0026gt; SELECT

by强制命令走索引，发现走索引的估算cost比顺序扫描的估算cost要低，说明了优化器为什么会选择顺序扫描。同样也说明估算出现了问题。 猜想 批量删除导致了顺序扫描耗时增加，可能和频繁删除插入导致磁盘物理顺序乱序有关，因此在遍历时需要访问更多的内存页。 优化器在history表上决策执行计划时参考的统计数据有问题，导致代价估算出现偏差，可能的原因是没有及时更新统计数据。 验证

主从复制机制可以保证从库断连恢复后数据一致性以及整体服务的可用性，但是如果主库故障就会导致写操作阻塞以及同步终止，这时就需要引入哨兵机制了（Sentinel）。\n哨兵的三任务 哨兵也是一个独立的redis进程，负责三个任务：监控、选主、通知\n监控：周期性地给所有的主从库发送 PING 命令，检测它们是否仍然在线运行。如果响应超时就会把对应节点标记为“下线状态”，如果主库下线，就需要进入选主任务 选主：当主库挂了就需要根据一定的规则（后边会说）选择一个从库实例作为新主库 通知：将新主库连接信息同步给其他从库和客户端，让主从重新建立起同步连接 哨兵集群 单哨兵的问题：\n单个哨兵故障会导致无法进行主从切换 哨兵自身网络延迟导致误判主节点下线 解决：哨兵集群\n原理：发布者/订阅者机制\n注意事项：所有哨兵的配置应该保持一致\n哨兵集群配置 哨兵配置文件中： sentinel monitor \u0026lt;master-name\u0026gt; \u0026lt;ip\u0026gt; \u0026lt;redis-port\u0026gt; \u0026lt;quorum\u0026gt; 可见哨兵只需要知道主节点ip端口，那么哨兵之间以及哨兵从节点之间是怎么感知的呢？\n哨兵之间如何建立连接 依托发布订阅机制。主库中有一个sentinel:hello”频道，当一个新哨兵加入后，会向所有订阅该频道的哨兵广播新哨兵的ip端口号，从而建立连接。\n哨兵从节点之前如何建立连接 哨兵向主库发送INFO命令获取所有从库ip端口，从而建立连接。\n监控 主观下线、客观下线 当哨兵发现响应超时后，会判断主库为“主观下线”状态，即“我认为主库下线了”，然后发送命令询问其他哨兵是否赞同这个判断，当赞同票超过配置文件中的quorum数量时，就可以标记主库为“客观下线”， quorum值默认是n/2+1（n为哨兵数）。\nps：客观下线只针对主库，对于从库判定主观下线就够了\n选主 在正式开始之前需要确认一点：选主的任务是由哪个哨兵执行的？\n投票选取leader哨兵 从候选者中通过投票选出leader负责接下来的主从故障转移。每个哨兵只有一次投票机会，候选者会把票投给自己。\n候选者是刚刚判定主节点客观下线的所有哨兵。\n成为leader条件：\n拿到半数以上赞成票 大于等于哨兵配置文件中的quorum值 选择新的主节点 选择的原则：（筛选+打分）打分阶段遇到最高分从库就选择它\n留下当前在线且之前超时次数小于10次的从库 优先级最高的从库得分高，优先级由用户配置 和旧主库同步程度最接近的从库得分高，主库从库在环形缓存数组（repl_backlog_buffer）上都有自己的复制进度offset，判断主从offset的距离 ID 号小的从库得分高，ID是实例编号 通知 通知从库和客户端\n通知从库 首先，向选定的节点发送slaveof no one命令将其升级为新主节点，然后通过slaveof ip port将其他所有从节点连接到新主节点。\n此外，还需要监听旧主节点，当他重新上线时需要将其转变成新主节点的从库。\n通知客户端 主从故障转移的每个事件都对应发布订阅机制中的一个频道，客户端可以订阅对应频道的消息得知主从切换状态。\n总结 多节点之前怎么协调的：\n相互感知：发布订阅 做决定：投票

Eratosthenes）对于每一个质数，标记它在n以内的所有倍数，根据推论可知当遍历结束后，所有合数都被标记。\n优点：相比于对n以内每个数朴素的单独判断，时间复杂度更低 缺点：对于同一个合数存在重复标记的现象（18: 2*9 3*6） 代码：\nfunc sieveOfEratosthenes(n int) { notPrime := map[int]bool{1: true} // 取反可以省略初始化过程 for i := 2; i*i \u0026lt;= n; i++ { if !notPrime[i] { for j := i * i; j \u0026lt;= n; j += i { // j从i*i开始，因为小于i*i的值已经在之前判断过了 notPrime[j] = true } } } } 欧拉筛 sieve of Euler 欧拉筛对于1到n的每个数，标记它与比它小的所有质数分别相乘得到的合数，在标记时注意保证合数是由其最小的质因数得到的（保证唯一标记的原理）。根据推论可知当遍历结束后，所有合数都被标记。\n优点：比埃氏筛更快，因为避免了合数的重复标记 缺点：需要额外的空间保存已经验证的质数，以空间换时间 代码：\nfunc sieveOfEuler(n int) { primes := []int{} notPrime := map[int]bool{1: true} for i := 2; i \u0026lt;= n; i++ { if !notPrime[i] { primes = append(primes, i) } for j := 0; j \u0026lt; len(primes) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; i*primes[j] \u0026lt;= n; j++ { notPrime[i*primes[j]] = true if i%primes[j] == 0 { // 保证每个合数都被其最小质因子筛去 break } } } } 代码中 i%primes[j] == 0 什么意思 假设：i = 4 时 primes = []int{2, 3}\n如果不做i%primes[j] == 0判断，那么会标记合数 4*3=12，\n那么当i = 6时，就会出现合数6*2=12的重复标记，而欧式筛正是为了避免这种情况的出现，对于合数，只由他的最小质因数筛去。\n为什么primes[j]之后的质数都跳过了？ 因为i是primes[j]的整数倍，那么他再乘后续的每个数都相当于(a*primes[j])*x（a：倍数，x：后续某个数），\n等价于primes[j]*(a*x)，这个a*x就留给之后的i了，就是为了保证每个合数只由他的最小质因数筛去。\n","permalink":"http://localhost:40585/posts/algorithm/prime/","summary":"文章介绍了判断质数的两种筛法：埃氏筛标记质数倍数但会重复标记合数，欧拉筛避免了重复但需额外空间存储验证过的质数。","title":"质数筛法"},{"content":"主从复制

一台服务器宕机不会影响整体服务 主从复制模式问题： 数据一致性问题（同步机制） 需要考虑故障转移（哨兵机制） 全量复制（初次同步） 初次同步三阶段：建立连接、同步数据、查漏补缺 建立连接 命令： replicaof 192.168.1.1 6379\n执行该命令将当前实例变成指定ip:host实例的从库。\n网络层面看，当前实例给主服务器发送psync同步请求（psync ? -1 ?表示未知的主库runID，-1表示第一次复制），主服务器收到后会返回FULLRESYNC全量复制命令响应，同时会携带runID（redis实例id）和offset（复制进度）\n连接建立以后，就准备进入全量复制阶段了。\n同步数据 主库通过bgsave命令通过fork出的子进程异步生成RDB文件，然后将文件发给从库。从库收到后，先清空当前数据库，然后加载RDB文件，为了避免从库中之前数据的影响。\n主从数据一致性问题 存在三个时间段，会导致新收到的写命令不会同步给从库：\n主库生成RDB文件期间 主库发送RDB文件期间 从库加载RDB文件期间 如果不进行特殊处理，数据库中数据越多RDB文件越大，导致的不一致情况也会越严重。\n解决办法：使用 replication buffer 缓冲区 在RDB发送过程中，将所有新增到的写命令记录到该缓冲区中，在收到从库的全量复制完成信号后，就进入第三阶段，复制缓冲区中的命令。\n查漏补缺 主库将replication buffer中的所有记录发送给从库，至此，主从之间的第一次同步就完成了。\n基于长连接的命令传播 在主从库完成第一次同步后，双方之间维护一个TCP长连接，目的是避免频繁的断开和连接带来的性能开销。\n当主库收到写操作时，会通过长连接传播给从库。\n增量复制 当主从库之间出现了网络问题，如何同步网络断连期间主库新增的写命令？\n重新进行全量复制（redis 2.8以前），开销很大 增量复制（目前采用的方法） 网络恢复后如何确定断开期间主库增量的数据？repl_backlog_buffer环形缓冲区。\nrepl_backlog_buffer repl_backlog_buffer是一个大小可指定的环形缓冲区，写操作不仅会写入 replication buffer，还会写入该环形缓冲区。主库和从库分别维护自己写到或读到的位置。\n当主从库之间的连接重新建立后，从库会发送psync命令请求同步，其中会携带复制进度offset。主库从而可以根据自己的offset和从库的offset判断断线期间新增的写命令有哪些，然后依次同步给从库。\n如果主库判断offset时发现从库要读取的数据已经被覆盖了，那么就会采用全量同步。\nps：环形缓冲区写满后，继续写入会覆盖掉之前的数据。如果从库的读取速度比较慢，就有可能导致从库还未读取的操作被主库新写的操作覆盖了，这会导致主从库间的数据不一致。\n解决：调整缓冲区大小\n总结

向主进程发送一条信号表示转换完成，主进程收到信号后通过信号处理函数将aof重写缓冲区中的内容追加到新的aof文件中。 主进程对新的aof文件进行改名，覆盖现有的aof文件。 fork fork出子进程而不是子线程\n多线程间会共享内存，当修改共享内存中的数据时就需要加锁来保证数据安全，造成性能的降低。\n而子进程会复制主进程的页表（记录着虚拟地址和物理地址映射关系），而不是物理内存中的所有数据，并且子进程对这个共享的内存拥有只读的权限，当父子进程任意一方进行修改时，就会发生写时复制。\n目的：提升性能，减少fork过程阻塞时间 写时复制 在发生写操作的时候，操作系统才会去复制物理内存中要被修改的这块数据，生成该数据的副本。然后在这个数据副本上进行修改。\n目的：节约物理内存资源 重写期间有数据被修改了，导致父子进程redis数据不一致的问题 解决办法：启用aof重写缓冲区\nredis内存中设置了重写缓冲区，当子进程创建以后开始使用。\n当主进程执行完一个写命令之后，会同时将这个写命令写入到AOF缓冲区和AOF重写缓冲区。\n双写的目的：保证重写失败依旧拥有完整aof日志，保证重写期间的修改操作不会遗漏。 总结 aof写回 -\u0026gt; 主进程 aof重写 -\u0026gt;

redisObject为不同类型的数据提供了统一的接口，使Redis可以用一致的方式处理不同类型的数据。\nstruct redisObject { unsigned type:4; // 数据类型 unsigned encoding:4; // 编码方式 // LRU 记录最末一次访问时间; 或者 LFU（8位频率，16位访问时间） unsigned lru:LRU_BITS; int refcount; // 引用计数，用于垃圾回收 void *ptr; // 指向底层数据结构实例 }; 简单动态字符串 SDS redis自己封装的字符串类型，四个字段（len现有长度，alloc分配的空间长度，flags SDS的类型，buf[]字符数组）\n与 C 语言原生字符串相比的优势 alloc和len字段\n避免了C语言中获取字符串长度需要遍历的缺点 可以保存二进制数据（C语言遇到\\0就表示字符串结束了） 字符串拼接时可以判断内存空间是否满足需求，避免溢出 字符串缩短时可以惰性释放空间，提高性能 flags字段\nflags类型是针对不同大小的字符串选择了不同比特位的int型变量，节约了内存空间。 PS：以上也是 golang 中string的设计思想（go中string拼接是开辟新内存然后依次copy过去）\n编译指令 在分配内存时采用**紧凑(packed)**的方式，避免内存对齐，同样为了节约内存。\nziplist 压缩列表 以动态数组的紧凑布局保存int或者string。在7.0被废弃。\n整体结构：\u0026lt;zlbytes\u0026gt; \u0026lt;zltail\u0026gt; \u0026lt;zllen\u0026gt; \u0026lt;entry\u0026gt; \u0026lt;entry\u0026gt; ... \u0026lt;entry\u0026gt; \u0026lt;zlend\u0026gt;\nzlbytes：列表内存占用大小 zltail：尾节点内存偏移量 zllen：节点总数 zlend：0xFF，末尾标记 entry结构：\u0026lt;prevlen\u0026gt; \u0026lt;encoding\u0026gt; \u0026lt;entry-data\u0026gt;\nprevlen：前一个entry大小 encoding：data存储的元素类型和长度 entry-data：实际数据 遍历 从左向右：计算prevlen占用内存，进而得到encoding起始地址，根据encoding编码可得数据大小，从而找到下一个entry起始地址。\n从右向左：通过prevlen和尾节点地址可以依次推导出上一个节点的地址\n优势 相对于普通数组，不需要预分配内存，且每个节点大小不必相同（通过encoding细化存储大小），节约内存。\n缺点 每次写操作（扩容缩容）都会进行内存分配 因为 encoding 对于不同类型不同大小的数据进行了细化，当数据大小变化时（新增节点导致prevlen内存占用变化），可能会引发连锁更新 元素越多对于列表中间节点的查找时间复杂度越高 listpack 紧凑列表 listpack是redis5.0中针对ziplist连锁更新的问题进行改良而来的数据结构，因此同样也属于紧凑布局。\n基本结构和ziplist相似\n整体结构：\u0026lt;lpbytes\u0026gt; \u0026lt;lplen\u0026gt; \u0026lt;entry\u0026gt; \u0026lt;entry\u0026gt; ...

的总长度，并且为了从右向左遍历使用了大端存储模式并将entry-len放到entry末尾。 遍历 从左向右：解析encoding可以得到元素类型和长度，并且可以进一步计算得到len本身的长度，从而找到下一个entry起始地址。\n从右向左：通过lpbytes总长度直接定位到尾部结束标记，然后从右到左逐个字节读取entry-len（当读到的字节最高位为0表示该结束了）,获得entry前两部分大小，从而可以定位到前一项entry的末尾，如此往复。\nquicklist 快表 redis7.0之前通过双向链表+ziplist实现，7.0之后改为双向链表+listpack。\nquicklist每个节点都保存一个ziplist/listpack，在添加元素时会检查插入位置的压缩列表是否能容纳该元素，如果能容纳就直接保存到 quicklistNode 结构里的压缩列表，如果不能容纳，才会新建一个新的 quicklistNode 结构。具体一个列表中可以容纳几个元素可以在配置文件中设置。\n优势 综合了链表和数组的优势，链表：可以动态增减节点；数组：内存连续节省空间 避免列表中节点过多导致的查询时间复杂度变高，分散列表负载 可以根据性能动态调整（修改配置文件），时间换空间或者空间换时间 缺点 由于融合了两种数据结构所以维护成本更高，7.0之前使用ziplist结构无法避免连锁更新问题。\n哈希表 桶数组+拉链法。插入一对k-v数据时，计算key的hash值并找到对应桶索引，遇到冲突则新建一个entry连接到链表尾。\nentry是链表中的节点，每个节点保存着key、value（存值或者指针）以及指向下一个节点的指针。\n一个hash结构有两个hash表，一个用来存储kv，另一个为空，在扩容时使用。\n哈希表的扩容 触发条件：\n服务器目前没有执行 BGSAVE 命令或者 BGREWRITEAOF 命令，并且负载因子大于等于1。 服务器目前正在执行 BGSAVE 命令或者 BGREWRITEAOF 命令，并且负载因子大于等于5。 ps：负载因子 = 哈希表已保存节点数量 / 哈希表大小 渐进式rehash过程： 为了避免大量数据集中拷贝带来的性能影响，故使用渐进式rehash，具体过程为：\n为那个空的哈希表分配两倍的内存空间 在rehash期间，增删改查操作都会在执行对应操作以外，按索引顺序一个一个将索引位置的数据从旧哈希表迁移到新表 当全部迁移完了，释放旧表的内存空间 和golang的map扩容思想非常相似，不过go中一个桶容量有限制，多出的放溢出桶，所以go中还存在等量扩容的情况 intset 整数集 三个字段：编码方式encoding、元素数量length、保存元素的数组contents[]。整数集实际上就是一个递增int数组。\n在添加每个元素时，intset会始终保持有序，目的是便于查找。\n其中contetns数组的int类型（int16、int32、int64）会根据元素的大小确定。\n适用于只存储int值且存储数量较少的情况。\n升级 当加入的新元素类型比现有的元素类型大时，需要对数组进行扩容：\n计算类型升级后数组所需要的空间，追加分配到原数组末尾。 从右向左依次转换原数组中的元素 添加新元素到数组末尾 优势：根据元素大小动态选择数组类型，可以节约内存资源。 ps：整数集没有降级操作。\nskiplist 跳表 跳表是一种多层有序链表（多级索引），目的是加速对于有序数据的快速定位和范围查询，单个查询平均时间复杂度 O(logN)。\ntypedef struct zskiplistNode { sds ele; // 元素值 double score; // 元素权重 struct zskiplistNode *backward; // 后向指针 struct zskiplistLevel { struct zskiplistNode *forward; // 前向指针 unsigned int span; // 跨度（离forward node的距离） } level[]; } zskiplistNode; typedef struct zskiplist { struct zskiplistNode *header, *tail; unsigned long length; int level; } zskiplist; level数组保存了当前节点在每一层的下一个节点以及跨度（如果有），最底层 level0 是一个双向链表保存所有的节点，其他的层都相当于是索引。\n问：在新建节点时如何确定在哪层？ 答：随机的。如果将每层节点数设置为下一层的一半会导致每次节点增删都可能需要调整level信息，带来额外的开销。\nradix tree 基数树 radix tree是前缀树（trie tree）的一种，相比于哈希表能更好的节省内存空间，于redis5.0引入。\nradix tree包含两类节点，非压缩节点（单个字符）和压缩节点（多字符），非叶子节点无法同时指向这两种子节点。\n叶子节点不包含字符，用于指向实际的值。\n目的：快速匹配，范围查询，节约内存\n应用：gin框架中的路由、golang中依靠radix tree对管理内存页的bitmap快速搜索\n五种基本类型 String 底层数据结构：int或SDS\n常用命令：SET GET SETNX SETEX

特性：用于存储地理位置信息，并对存储的信息进行操作，包括计算两点距离以及获取区域内元素。\n底层原理：直接使用zset，使用GeoHash编码方式将经纬度转换为Zset中的元素权重分数\n常用命令：GEOADD GEOPOS GEODIST GEORADIUS\n应用场景：滴滴打车\nStream 在5.0之前，消息队列是使用list实现的，但是存在以下的几点问题：\n如果需要判断重复消息，生产者需要自行为每条消息生成一个全局唯一ID。 消息可靠性无法保证，当消费者处理时出现宕机会导致当前消息丢失。可以创建一个备份list，但无法完全保证可靠。 不支持多个消费者消费同一条消息 不支持消费组的实现，消费组：组内一个成员读取了消息，同组其他成员就不能再读取同一个消息了。 stream的出现目的就是让消息队列更加稳定可靠。\n特性：自动生成ID、支持ack确认消息的模式、支持消息持久化、支持消费组\n底层数据结构：radix tree + listpack，radix树中key值为消息ID，value是listpack结构存储的具体数据。\n常用命令：XADD XLEN [XREAD STREAM] XDEL XRANGE XREADGROUP XPNDING XACK\n应用场景：消息队列、负载均衡\n功能：\n消息保序：XADD/XREAD 阻塞读取：XREAD block 重复消息处理：Stream 在使用 XADD 命令，会自动生成全局唯一 ID； 消息可靠性：内部使用 PENDING List 自动保存消息，使用 XPENDING 命令查看消费组已经读取但是未被确认的消息，消费者使用 XACK 确认消息； 支持消费组形式消费数据 缺点：\n可靠性：在以下 2 个场景下，都会导致数据丢失： AOF 持久化配置为每秒写盘，但这个写盘过程是异步的，Redis 宕机时会存在数据丢失的可能 主从复制也是异步的，主从切换时，也存在丢失数据的可能。 可堆积：队列长度超过上限后，旧消息会被删除，只保留固定长度的新消息。 ps：发布/订阅机制为什么不可以作为消息队列？1.不具备数据持久化的能力（不会记录到日志文件）2.发后即忘 3.消息积压会导致消费端断开\n","permalink":"http://localhost:40585/posts/redis/data_structure/","summary":"详细分析了redis底层数据结构，由下到上认识了基本数据类型以及优点缺点。","title":"redis 数据结构"},{"content":"redis 全景图 两维度三主线 两维度：应用维度，系统维度 三主线（三高）：高性能，高可靠，高可扩展 问题画像图 内部基本架构 CS架构 Redis采用了CS（客户端-服务器）架构。客户端发出请求，例如GET、SET、SUBSCRIBE等命令，服务器接收这些命令并执行，然后将结果返回给客户端。\n服务器：通常指的是运行Redis服务软件的计算机，这个服务会监听特定的端口，接收来自客户端的连接请求。服务器存储并管理所有Redis的数据，并处理所有与数据相关的命令请求。 客户端：向Redis服务器发送命令并读取服务器返回结果的一方。客户端可以是运行在命令行的Redis cli工具，或者是在应用程序中使用的Redis库。 举个例子，如果你在你的电脑上安装了Redis，并在命令行中输入redis-cli来启动Redis的命令行客户端，那你就是客户端，你正在操作的这个计算机就是服务器。\n这样，通过客户端和服务器的相互作用，Redis可以作为一个中间人，允许应用程序存储和检索值，或者在一组订阅者之间发布和接收消息。\nCS架构优势 分布式：在CS架构中，任务和资源分布在不同的机器上，可以利用网络将分散的资源和处理能力整合在一起，提高整体性能。 易维护：服务器集中处理数据和业务逻辑，方便进行数据备份和恢复，以及版本更新和业务变更。 可扩展性：通过增加服务器的数量，可以方便地扩展系统的处理能力，满足业务的增长需求。 安全性：服务器可以实行集中控制和安全保护，可以进行有效的安全管理，如防火墙、访问控制等。 便于管理：管理员只需要在服务器端进行维护，用户不需要对软件进行复杂的设置和管理。 数据一致性：所有的数据都存储在服务器端，客户端只是获取和操作数据，因此可以很好地保证数据的一致性。 负载均衡：服务器可以根据负载情况，动态分配任务给客户端，促进资源的合理利用。 但同时，CS架构也有其局限性，例如服务器是系统的瓶颈，服务器出问题可能影响到所有的客户端。因此，在实际应用中需要权衡各种因素，选择适合的架构。\n","permalink":"http://localhost:40585/posts/redis/overall/","summary":"从宏观俯瞰redis","title":"redis 全景图"},{"content":"select 关键字 参考 draveness select关键字\n设计思想 与操作系统中多路复用模型相似，同时监听多个 channel 状态，等待变为可读或可写。\n与 switch 关键字的控制结构相似，只不过 select 的 case 表达式必须是 channel 的收发操作。\nselect 两个特别之处：\n在 channel 上可以进行非阻塞的收发操作 在多个 case 同时满足收发状态时，随机执行其中之一 非阻塞收发 当 select 中存在 default 分支时，只需要知道其他分支中的 channel 收发状态是否就绪，如果全部未就绪就会执行 default 分支上的操作。\n因此，在其他分支上对于 channel 的读写操作都是非阻塞的，具体实现见channel这一部分。\n随机执行 在 runtime.selectgo 开头，通过 runtime.fastrandn 函数随机打乱case的轮询顺序 pollOrder。\n目的：避免饥饿问题的发生\n实现原理 每个case对应一个 runtime.scase 结构体，结构体中保存着收发操作目标 channel 和接收到的数据要放到的内存地址（等号左边变量指针）。\n编译期间 在编译过程中，会根据 case 的不同情况对控制语句进行优化：\n不存在任何case：调用 gopark 永久阻塞当前 goroutine。\n只存在一个case：改写为 if 条件语句判断是否为 nil channel，是则永久阻塞当前 goroutine，否则正常执行 channel 的收发操作。\n一个普通case，一个default：改写为 if-else条件语句，if 中调用非阻塞channel收发函数，当返回的状态为未就绪时，执行 else 中的逻辑。\n多个case：将所有case转化为 runtime.scase 结构体数组，调用 runtime.selectgo 函数确定可执行的case对应的结构体。\n运行时期间 运行时主要就是执行 runtime.selectgo 这个函数，目的是确定可执行的scase结构体。\n主要步骤：\n初始化两顺序：随机打乱轮询顺序（避免饥饿），按照channel地址排序确定加锁顺序（避免死锁）。如果 case 中 channel 为 nil，则在后续的轮询中忽略这个case（不加入顺序切片）。 给 select 中的所有 channel 加锁。 按轮询顺序遍历所有 case 查找存在的准备就绪的 channel，如果有，立刻执行，解锁全部channel后返回。 对于非阻塞操作（存在 default），直接全部解锁并返回。 按加锁顺序遍历所有 case，将当前 goroutine 包装为 sudog，加入每一个channel的等待队列中，此外还会附着在当前 goroutine 的 waiting 链表末尾。 调用 gopark 暂止当前 goroutine，解锁所有 channel，等待有就绪事件时被唤醒。 给 select 中的所有 channel 加锁。 按加锁顺序遍历所有 case，找到就绪的 case，将其他case中没有被用到的 sudog 从 channel 等待队列出队并释放掉。 解锁所有 channel，返回选中的case的索引，从而可以执行对应的逻辑。 不按顺序加锁为什么会导致死锁？ 在并发加锁的时候会出现问题。例如：两个goroutine中分别有两个select，g1按顺序对 chan1、chan2 加锁，g2按顺序对 chan2、chan1 加锁。\n由于select需要将内部所有channel都加锁才会执行任务，当按g1-chan1、g2-chan2顺序加锁时，g1-chan2、g2-chan1会阻塞，导致死锁。\nnil channel 的用处与原理 在上述步骤1中，确定 case 轮询顺序时不会包括channel为nil的case，从而在后续的遍历过程中不会涉及这种case，因此可以说 nil channel 的 case 被永久阻塞了。\n将某个case的channel置为nil可以禁用当前分支，而且其他的分支不会受影响。这样做可以在for...select...这种结构中避免一个已经完成所有任务的channel反复被检查，节约了系统资源。\n","permalink":"http://localhost:40585/posts/golang/select/","summary":"select关键字用于多路通信和同步，可以同时监听多个channel的状态，并等待其中一个channel就绪。它具有非阻塞收发和随机执行的特点，通过编译和运行时的优化与机制来实现多路通信。select是Go中处理并发通信和同步的强大工具。","title":"Go

事件驱动机制，使用特定的系统调用（select、poll、epoll等）阻塞地监听一组文件描述符，当文件描述符就绪（状态转变为可读或者可写）时，通知程序继续进行相应的I/O操作。\n多路复用也属于同步策略，与NIO比较类似，只不过是由特定的系统调用负责去轮询资源是否就绪，而不是用户线程亲力亲为\n为什么属于同步策略：特定系统调用只负责告诉用户程序资源是否就绪，而（在read调用中）数据从内核复制到用户内存的操作还是由用户程序发送系统调用触发\n为什么可以处理大量连接：NIO一个请求需要一个线程去处理，而多路复用则是做到了多路请求复用一个线程，大大减少了资源占用\n优点：可以同时处理大量连接，减小系统开销，响应性能好 缺点：select和poll都使用线性结构（数组和链表）存储文件描述符，需要拷贝到内核内存开销大，返回就绪事件需要遍历时间复杂度高，select还有数组大小限制 此外，由于特定系统调用是轮询的并且拷贝数据的时候用户线程也是阻塞的，所以多路复用只有在处理高并发请求的时候才能体现性能优势。\nepoll epoll解决了select、poll存在的内存开销和时间复杂度问题\nepoll使用红黑树的数据结构追踪所有待检测的文件描述符，每次只需要加入一个待检测的文件描述符，而不像select、poll一样每次操作都穿入整个集合，加入时间复杂度O(logn)\n维护wait链表来记录就绪事件，而不是遍历整个集合\n事件驱动 边缘触发：当被监控的文件描述符上第一次出现事件就绪时，通知用户程序 水平触发：当被监控的文件描述符上存在就绪事件，通知用户程序 go中的网络轮询器netpoll netpoll的实现原理是多路复用+NIO（见最后总结部分），go中使用原生网络模型构建tcp server时，网络模型底层就是基于netpoll实现的\ngo中使用 runtime.pollDesc 封装操作系统的文件描述符，空闲描述符以链表形式存储。\n五个函数\nfunc netpollinit() // 创建实例 func netpollopen(fd uintptr, pd *pollDesc) int32 // 注册fd func netpoll(delta int64) gList // 等待事件操作 func netpollBreak() // 停止epoll func netpollIsPollDescriptor(fd uintptr) bool // 判断fd是否被netpoll使用 go中针对不同平台采用了不同版本的网络轮询模块，linux-epoll，darwin-kqueue\u0026hellip;下面以epoll为例。\n初始化 netpollinit 函数只会在初始化网络IO或文件IO或计时器时调用一次（sync.Once来实现），其作用是：\n创建一个新的epoll文件描述符 创建一个用于通信的管道 将 netpollBreakRd 通知信号量封装成 epollevent 事件结构体注册进 epoll 实例。 netpollBreakRd 是一个用于传递控制信号的管道，监听这个事件的目的是为了实现网络轮询的终止。 然后，会批量初始化pollDesc并调用 netpollopen 函数注册轮询事件监听文件描述符（如net包中的listener fd）到epoll实例\n等待事件 当在文件描述符上执行读写操作时（如net包中对请求Read或Write），会调用runtime.poll_runtime_pollWait：\n检查描述符状态，如果fd不可读/写，则会执行gopark让出当前线程，将Goroutine转换到休眠状态。 将goroutine保存在pollDesc中（pollDesc是go封装的文件描述符），将pollDesc加入epoll底层基于红黑树的阻塞队列eventpoll.rbr中。 等待描述符变为可读或可写之后通知运行时，唤醒休眠的Goroutine。 轮询等待 调用netpoll函数获取需要唤醒的goroutines：\n根据传入的参数确定epoll系统调用需要等待的时间（永久阻塞、非阻塞、有限期阻塞）。 通过epollwait 系统调用获取待处理事件的数量。 根据返回的待处理事件数量将eveentpoll.rdllist就绪链表中的额所有pollDesc中存储的Goroutine加入运行队列（本地或全局）等待调度器的调度。 原生网络库 调度过程 netpoll的价值 前置知识：\n当一个运行的 G 发生系统调用时，不只是 G 会被阻塞，执行该 G 的 M 也会被阻塞， go并发的优势就在于将任务的执行载体细化到了用户级的 G 不使用netpoll会存在的问题：\n对于I/O密集型任务，大量系统调用会导致 M 频繁的挂起、新建、唤醒，背离了golang运行时调度的设计思想，即程序的控制权掌握在用户进程而不是内核，导致无法使用强大的调度器进行并发调度了 netpoll的价值：\n发生系统调用时，运行时将 G park住并将包装后的描述符加入epoll等待就绪，避免了因为陷入内核态导致 M 被阻塞，因此这个 M 还可以继续配合调度器运行新的 G。 总结 为什么说 netpoll 是 NIO + 多路复用？ NIO指的是对于线程 M，发生I/O操作时不会因为系统调用而被阻塞\n多路复用指的是操作系统层面，使用提供的 epoll、kqueue等多路复用技术\nnetpoll优势 保证了在I/O密集型服务中，go依旧可以实现在运行中进行用户级调度，提高了并发能力，减少了系统资源占用\nnetpoll存在的问题

根据对象的存活时间进行分类。（JAVA：年轻代、老年代、永久代）\n优点：相比传统标记清除 STW 更小，分代选取不同垃圾收集策略，效率高。 缺点：额外开销，内存占用，且golang中编译器会通过逃逸分析将大部分新生对象存储在栈上（栈直接被回收），因此没必要。 标记清除 从根对象出发，将确定存活的对象进行标记，并清扫可以回收的对象。\n优点：简单 缺点：需要长时间 STW 三色标记清除 优化的标记清除算法，将对象分为三类：黑、白、灰，保证与用户程序并发执行时程序的正确性（对象不会被错误回收）\n优点：利用并发的优势，大幅减小 STW 时间 缺点：复杂，需要配合屏障技术，否则会出现悬挂指针问题（一个还在生命周期的对象被错误回收了） 收集策略 并发和增量策略都需要配合屏障技术保证回收的正确性\n增量 增量式收集是将一个完整的 GC 过程切成多个更小的 GC 时间片，穿插在用户程序之间执行，在执行时仍需要 STW。 目的：减少了每次 STW 用户程序需要等待的时间，将总等待时间分散到多个时间片中。 并发 利用多核优势在部分阶段与用户程序并行执行 目的：减少了总的 STW 时间 三色抽象 概念 三类对象：\n白色对象：未被回收器扫描到的对象。回收开始阶段全部对象都为白色，扫描结束后存在的白色对象为不可达对象。 灰色对象：已经被回收器扫描但存在指针指向一些还没被扫描白色对象。（波面） 黑色对象：对象本身以及其所有指针指向的对象都被扫描过，确定存活的对象。 三色不变性 想要在并发或者增量的标记算法中保证正确性，我们需要达成以下两种三色不变性（Tri-color invariant）中的一种：\n强三色不变性 — 黑色对象不会指向白色对象，只会指向灰色对象或者黑色对象；（黑色不能指向白色） 弱三色不变性 — 黑色对象指向的白色对象必须包含一条从灰色对象经由多个白色对象的可达路径；（黑色可以指向白色，前提是必须要有另外的灰色对象直接或间接指向这个白色） 为什么要三个色？ 为了配合屏障技术，保证在并发或者增量执行时不会出现悬挂指针（本来不应该被回收的对象却被回收了）。\n具体来说，就是要保证达成至少一种三色不变性。\n屏障技术 是一种同步机制，使用户程序在进行指针写操作时，能够“通知”回收器，进而不会破坏三色不变性，保证在增量或并发回收时程序的正确性\nDijkstra 插入写屏障 在修改引用时，将新指向的对象置灰。换句话说，目的是将有存活可能的对象都标记成灰色\nwritePointer(slot, ptr): shade(ptr) *slot = ptr slot是代码中的接收位置（destination），ptr是被指向的对象，ptr需要进入slot中（goes into the slot）\n如图所示，用户程序修改A的指针，将其指向C，这时写屏障触发将C标记为灰色，在收集器启动时，将从B C 两个对象出发进行扫描。\n保证了强三色不变性。 是一种保守的屏障技术。 可能会遗留不再存活的对象，如图中的B，或者当图中第二三步间重新改变A指向B后的C。 栈上对象也需要保证回收正确性，因此需要为栈对象添加写屏障或STW并重新扫描栈上对象，GO1.7版本以前采用了后者。 Yuasa 删除写屏障 在删除引用时，如果原来指向的对象为白色，则将其置灰。目的是间接保留原有的引用关系使得扫描可以进行下去。\nwritePointer(slot, ptr) shade(*slot) *slot = ptr 第二步由于B本来就是灰色的，所以不用改；第三步将B指向C的引用删除，这时如果不将C染成灰色，后续收集器就不会扫描白色的C和D，于是CD被错误的回收了。\n如果第二步 A 指向了另外一个独立的白色对象 E 岂不是出错了？ 这种情况不可能出现，原因见下边第三点。 保证了弱三色不变性。 同样会遗留不再存活的对象。 【very important！】指针更新一定是从一个活动对象指向另一个活动对象，因为非活动对象是没有任何指针引用的，用户程序不可能再引用到它。换句话说，不可能新增一个指向孤立的白色对象的引用 混合写屏障 插入和删除写屏障都存在的问题：对栈对象加屏障严重拖累性能，尤其对于go来说（goroutine可以很多）\n如果不对栈对象加屏障，那么会导致的问题：\n只用插入屏障：一个黑色栈对象指向一个白色堆对象，并且原来灰色对象指向该白对象的指针被删除了，的会导致悬挂指针问题，需要标记后 STW 重新扫描所有栈对象。 只用删除屏障：标记结束后不需要重扫栈，但是图1-\u0026gt;图2过程会导致悬挂指针。 因此，选择混合写屏障（插入+删除）可以避免指针悬挂问题，且不用标记结束后重新扫栈，提高了效率。\nwritePointer(slot, ptr): shade(*slot) if current stack is grey: shade(ptr) *slot = ptr 此外，要将创建的所有新对象都标记成黑色，防止新分配的对象被错误地回收。\n垃圾回收的触发 触发阈值 通过环境变量 GOGC 设置，默认为100，即增长 100% 的堆内存才会触发 GC。\n不同于进入 STW 以后进行垃圾收集的方法，并发收集器并不能等到堆内存达到触发阈值时才开始运行，因为在 GC 期间还会有用户程序在分配新的堆内存。\n所以使用 Pacing 算法计算触发 GC 的最佳时间，使得收集（标记扫描）结束时堆内存近似达到阈值\n触发时机 可以分为三种情况：\n后台定时检查，当一定时间内没有触发（默认2min），就会触发新的 GC 循环。 用户程序手动触发，如果当前没有开启 GC ，则触发新的循环。 申请内存时根据堆大小触发，当堆内存达到阈值时，则触发新的循环。 后台触发 运行时在应用程序启动时创建的一个专门用于触发垃圾收集的goroutine，大多数时间是在休眠的，由 sysmon 在满足触发条件的时候唤醒。\n手动触发 用户程序通过 runtime.GC 函数主动通知运行时执行\n分配内存 在分配微对象和小对象的内存时，如果mcache中找不到空闲内存单元，则会向下层申请mspan并触发 GC。\n在分配大对象之前，一定会先触发 GC 回收内存。\nGC 实现 核心函数 runtime.gcStart，开启一个 GC 循环。\n垃圾回收三状态 垃圾回收器通过 _GCoff、_GCMark 和 _GCMarktermination 三个标记来确定写屏障状态\n_GCoff ----\u0026gt; _GCmark ----\u0026gt; _GCmarktermination /\\ | |___________________________________| _GCoff：清理状态; 写屏障关闭\n_GCmark：标记状态；写屏障开启\n_GCmarktermination：标记终止状态；写屏障开启\n垃圾回收四阶段 清理终止阶段（STW）\u0026ndash;\u0026gt; 标记阶段 \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; 标记终止阶段（STW）\u0026ndash;\u0026gt; 清理阶段\n清理终止阶段 状态 _GCoff；所有处理器在这时进入安全点；对上个垃圾回收阶段进行一些收尾工作（例如清理缓存池、清理已经被标记的内存单元、清理标记等等）， 以及完成进入标记阶段前的一些准备工作（启动后台标记任务、更新 GC 组件中相关变量），进入 STW 状态。\n标记阶段 状态切换至 _GCmark；扫描栈上、全局变量等根对象并将它们加入队列，将所有P的微分配器中的对象置灰，以及开启写屏障，退出 STW 状态，程序恢复执行，后台标记任务开始恢复进行。\n标记终止阶段 当所有的标记任务都完成后，进入 STW 状态，状态切换至 _GCmarktermination；以及完成标记的收尾工作（统计数据、重制状态等），关闭写屏障。\n清理阶段 状态切换至 _GCoff；退出 STW 状态，后台并发清理所有的内存管理单元\n总之，在访问公共资源时需要进入 STW 状态，进行扫描标记时要开启写屏障 如何暂停和恢复程序 暂停：抢占所有的处理器P，将他们更新至 _Pgcstop 状态\n恢复：依次唤醒所有的处理器\n后台标记模式 在步骤1（标记阶段开始前），运行时会为全局每个处理器创建一个用于后台标记任务的 Goroutine（遍历 runtime.allp），这些 Goroutine 都会与P绑定成为 node结构体 被加入 runtime.gcBgMarkWorkerPool 线程池并陷入休眠等待调度器的唤醒；程序恢复后在调度循环中寻找可运行的G runtime.findrunnable 的时候被从池中取出调度到P上运行。\n这些后台标记任务被称为 gcMarkWorker\nworker有三种模式：\ngcMarkWorkerDedicatedMode：处理器专门负责标记对象，不会被调度器抢占 gcMarkWorkerFractionalMode：当垃圾收集的后台CPU 使用率达不到预期时（默认为 25%），启动该类型的工作协程帮助垃圾收集达到利用率的目标 gcMarkWorkerIdleMode：当处理器没有可以执行的 Goroutine 时，它会运行垃圾收集的标记任务直到被抢占 在调度循环中会根据全局处理器的个数以及垃圾收集的 CPU 利用率确定worker的工作模式\n三种模式相互协同保证了标记的速率，在到达堆内存触发阈值前完成标记任务\n辅助标记 在并发标记阶段期间，当 Goroutine 调用 runtime.mallocgc 分配新对象时，该函数会检查申请内存的 Goroutine 是否处于入不敷出的状态：它遵循一条非常简单并且朴实的原则，分配多少内存就需要完成多少标记任务。\n假设如果有个Goroutine一直大量的分配内存，这样有可能永远都扫描不完所有对象，或者当扫描结束时堆内存已经到了一个很夸张的大小。所以辅助标记就是为了避免这种情况。\n后台标记模式和辅助标记区别：\n后台标记是通过并发加快标记的速度，以保证到达触发阈值时完成标记任务；\n辅助标记是在后台并发标记期间，当前 goroutine 分配内存时，通过控制分配与标记的“动态平衡”，保证到达触发阈值时完成标记任务；\n观察程序GC的四种方法 GODEBUG GODEBUG=gctrace=1 ./main 输出\ngc 1 @0.000s 2%: 0.009+0.23+0.004 ms clock, 0.11+0.083/0.019/0.14+0.049 ms cpu,

模式进行类比，目的都在于可以合理的分配资源以及保证高效率\n具体而言，零售店（线程缓存mcache）拥有很多种类的商品（可以看做是空闲内存空间或者内存页），每种商品由一个售货员（mspan）进行管理（记录售出状态）和负责销售，零售店的优势就在于\n离顾客（goroutine）家很近，买东西比较便捷。当顾客需要买数量较少的商品时（微对象小对象）直接去零售店就好，如果要大批量订货（大对象）则需要直接去工厂，零售店的库存肯定不够。\n当零售店库存不足时，会向经销商（mcentral）进货。经销商拥有所有种类的商品。\n当经销商也没有足够的库存时，就要向工厂（mheap）进货。工厂仓库（arena）中存着所有已经生产完的商品，当仓库中所有的货都被预定了没有可售商品时，就会找原料供应商（操作系统）进货。\n获得原料（page）后，就会进行加工并且规划一些新仓库存放（堆扩容）。\n供货链采用三个层级的策略，减少了顾客需要亲自去工厂交易的繁琐，也保证了工厂不会将大量时间花在处理小订单上边，提高了商品流通的效率。\n设计原则 分配器 线性分配器 依靠指针的增量来确定下一个可用的内存位置，需要搭配具有拷贝特性的垃圾回收算法（标记压缩、复制回收、分代回收等）整理内存碎片，JAVA采用的分配方法，对于C/C++等直接对外暴露指针的语言不适用。\n优点：复杂度较低\n缺点：无法重用回收的内存（整理碎片之前）\n空闲链表分配器 将内存块通过指针连成链表，空闲链表分配器可以选择不同的策略在链表中的内存块中进行选择。\n优点：可重用回收的内存\n缺点：分配时需要遍历链表\n四种内存分配策略 首次适应（First-Fit）— 从链表头开始遍历，选择第一个大小大于申请内存的内存块； 循环首次适应（Next-Fit）— 从上次遍历的结束位置开始遍历，选择第一个大小大于申请内存的内存块； 最优适应（Best-Fit）— 从链表头遍历整个链表，选择最合适的内存块； 隔离适应（Segregated-Fit）— 将内存分割成多个链表，每个链表中的内存块大小相同，申请内存时先找到满足条件的链表，再从链表中选择合适的内存块； 其中，隔离适应与GO使用的策略相似： 分配思想 分级分配 它将对象划分为多个不同的大小级别（go中为微对象、小对象、大对象），并使用不同的分配器来管理每个级别的内存分配。通过分级分配，可以更好地适应不同大小对象的内存需求，提高整体的内存管理效率和空间利用率。\n注：分配器和分配思想是两个不同层面的概念，分级分配是在宏观层面为新对象选择合适的缓存存储级别，而分配器则面向底层内存分配的具体实现。 内存布局 mspan是内存管理单元，负责管理内存页和分配的对象\nmcache作用相当于缓存，它缓存了一些可以直接拿来用的内存管理单元，直接满足当前线程的内存需求，不用加锁步骤简单速度很快。\nmcentral像是一个二级缓存，按种类不同每类保存一些可以拿来用的内存管理单元，方便mcache层快速获取想要的种类。\nmheap由一个个的arena构成，arena作为虚拟内存的索引可以快速定位内存中的几页。\n注：不是一个mcache对应一个mcentral哦 go1.11以前堆内存空间是连续的，1.11中改为使用稀疏内存，runtime.heapArena 管理 pagesPerArena 个页（不同平台可能不同，但页都是8KB）\n注：go语言的页（8KB）由运行时自己定义的，与操作系统的页（大部分4KB）不同。更大的页可以减少内存管理开销（小对象可以挤一挤）、提高缓存命中率（大对象不用分太碎）以及满足对齐需求。 核心组件 mspan runtime.mspan 是GO语言内存管理的基本单元，每个mspan管理npages个GO页并持有管理的页的占用情况。每个mspan作为相同spanClass大小等级的双向链表中的一个节点相互引用。\n最小分配单位是对象（object）而不是页，object的大小是由mspan的跨度类（spanClass）决定的 对象间通过 FreeList 链表形式连接。\nFreelist是一种特殊的链表形式，通过节点值的高8字节确定下个节点的内存地址，而不是传统的保存一个Next指针字段。可以节省内存。 spanClass runtime.spanClass 是mspan的跨度类，它决定了内存管理单元中存储的对象大小和个数。\n源码中预存储了67个跨度类尺寸 (size class)，运行时中还包含1个id为0的特殊跨度类，它能够管理大于 32KB 的特殊对象。\n跨度类一共有 68 * 2 = 136 个：68个尺寸（size class），每种尺寸有两个类型（ scan 和 noscan ），noscan表示对象不包含指针所以不会被GC扫描，可以提高GC效率。\n一个spanClass由一个 uint8 表示，其中高7位是id，最后一位表示 scan 或 noscan。\n在运行时分配对象时会根据对象大小选择适合的跨度类。也正是与上述隔离适应策略的相似之处。\nmcache 线程缓存，会与处理器 P 一一绑定，主要用来缓存微小对象。每一个线程缓存都在 mcache.alloc 数组中持有 68 * 2 个 runtime.mspan，每一个数组元素都是某一个特定大小的 mspan 的链表头指针。\n拥有微对象分配器，专门管理16B以下的非指针类型的对象，\n优势：由于与P绑定，所以不会有并发问题，访问时不用加锁，效率更高。（为什么不与M绑定：M可能陷入休眠状态，期间无法复用缓存）\n初始化 在初始化处理器P时会调用 runtime.allomcache 在系统栈中使用 mheap 中的线程缓存分配器进行初始化。\nmcentral 中心缓存，每个中心缓存管理一种跨度类对应的内存管理单元（mspan），总共136个由mheap保存。这些mspan由四个 spanSet 存储，分别是：\n包含空闲对象的 partial set: [swept,unswept]\n不包含空闲对象 full set: [swept,unswept]\n垃圾回收器完成对某个内存跨度的扫描和标记操作后，该内存跨度就被认为是 \u0026ldquo;swept\u0026rdquo; 访问中心缓存中的内存管理单元需要使用互斥锁：\nmheap 页堆，以全局变量形式 runtime.mheap_ 存储，包含了长度为136（scan \u0026amp; noscan）的mcentral数组，持有的mspan列表以及所有的 heapArena（由二维数组存储）。\nheapArena GO堆在逻辑上划分为多个 heapArena ，可以把 heapArena 看作“堆块”， 每“块”里有 heapArenaBytes / pageSize 个页， 分别由 mspan 进行管理。\n对象分配 入口: runtime.newobject，new关键字的实现\n在分配时，会占有m线程，并根据对象大小和是否为指针类型（scan）确定分配逻辑：\nif size \u0026lt;= 32KB { if noscan \u0026amp;\u0026amp; size \u0026lt; 16B { 分配微对象 } else { 分配小对象 } } else { 分配大对象 } 大对象 对于size\u0026gt;32KB的对象，直接在堆上进行分配。\n流程 计算需要的pages，然后进入系统栈尝试获取新的mspan\n在分配之前先回收一部分内存以避免内存大量占用\n【mheap加锁】内存分配、mspan初始化 【mheap解锁】\n从堆上分配新的内存页和内存管理单元mspan（id为0的特殊mspan），如果堆空间不足还要考虑扩容（向操作系统申请空间），如果p0上的mspan缓存 runtime.p.mspancache 不足还要用 runtime.fixalloc 分配器分配 页内存分配使用的是全局的页分配器 runtime.pageAlloc（Radix tree） 初始化刚刚获得的mspan，并且建立mheap和mspan的关系（加入heapArena.spans）\n清理新分配的内存，进行归零操作\n返回mspan中的base地址 mspan.startAddr\n小对象 对于16B\u0026lt;=size\u0026lt;=32KB的对象和size\u0026lt;16但包含指针B的对象，，先后尝试从线程缓存、中心缓存、堆中获取mspan，如果没找到可用的则从操作系统分配新页\n流程 根据对象大小找到对应的跨度类，尝试从mcache的mspan数组缓存（mcache.alloc）中的获取对应的mspan，通过 mspan.allocCache（保存对象空闲状态的位图，原理：德布鲁因序列）寻找能够容纳当前对象的空闲对象内存空间，如果有则完成分配\n如果上一步没有找到分配空间，则需要调用 runtime.refill 向上级组件获取mspan替换已经不存在可用对象的当前mspan\n将当前的mspan（已满）放入 mcentral 的 full set\n尝试从 mcentral的 partial swept set获取一个mspan\n尝试从 mcentral的 partial unswept set获取一个mspan，并且sweep它\n尝试从 mcentral的 full unswept set获取一个mspan，并且sweep它， 如果sweep后发现没有空闲空间，则放到 full swept set中\n如果尝试100次获取后（go1.21）依旧没有找到可用的mspan， 则继续向堆申请\n向堆申请流程与大对象分配流程一致（只有span size不同） 初始化mspan字段以及初始化heapArena中该mspan的位图信息等字段 至此，寻找能用的mspan的流程终于结束了\n将新获取到的mspan保存在（mcache.alloc）中，并且返回新mspan中的空闲内存地址（freeIndex）\n微对象 对于size\u0026lt;16且不包含指针（noscan）B的对象，使用mcache中的微分配器（mcache.tiny等字段）分配。主要目标是短字符串和逃逸的临时变量\n一个tiny内存块（由maxTinySize决定，16B）中可以存多个微对象，大家挤一挤从而节省了空间。而释放内存时，要等块中所有的对象都被标记为垃圾时才会进行。\n逃逸变量：函数内部定义的局部变量，但在函数结束后仍然被其他对象或函数引用的变量（指针作为返回值等）\n为什么必须要是noscan：为了保证潜在浪费的内存量是有限的（the amount of potentially wasted memory is bounded.）\n流程 先根据对象的size进行一些内存对齐的操作，调整 mcache.tinyoffset 的内存地址 为什么要内存对齐：减少 CPU 访问内存的次数。因为 CPU 是以字长为单位访问内存的而不是字节。 看看当前tiny内存块中是否装得下（tinyoffset+size \u0026lt;= maxTinySize），装得下则直接分配，返回对象内存地址\n否则，同小对象分配流程一样获取一个mspan替换旧的tiny块，唯二不同是span size和不用对新分配的内存进行清零（why？）\n返回分配到的内存地址\n总结 GO中内存布局利用了多级缓存以及隔离适应策略（划分多个size class），优化了内存分配的效率，提高了空间利用率，并且由运行时全权管理堆区内存，方便了开发者。这也正是golang内存占用小、运行速度快、使用简便的原因之一。\n","permalink":"http://localhost:40585/posts/golang/memory/","summary":"介绍了go内存分配的三级模型，还讨论了分配器的种类和设计原则，以及内存布局的组件和对象分配的流程。整体而言，Go的内存分配器通过多级缓存和分级分配的思想，提高了内存管理的效率和空间利用率。","title":"Go

goroutine 创建和销毁 内核级（内存空间、文件描述符等） 内核级 （优化：线程池） 用户级 切换 切换页表刷新TLB（主要影响）、PCB切换， 慢 保存各种寄存器，较慢 只保存三个：PC，SP，BP，快 内存占用 独立的虚拟内存 1MB+“guard page” 初始2KB 进程切换 = 指令序列切换 + 资源切换 线程切换 = 指令序列切换 + 共享资源 为什么线程轻量 同一个进程下，线程之间的共享内存空间（内存占用），所以创建和销毁时只需要关心自己独有的数据，还可以利用线程池进一步减小成本（创建和销毁），进行切换时不需要切换页表（切换）\n为什么goroutine更轻量 同样共享进程内存空间，且栈空间会动态变化，可以减少内存浪费（内存占用），创建和销毁由 Go 运行时（ Go runtime ）负责管理，成本很小是用户级的。（创建和销毁）只需要保存和恢复 Goroutine 的上下文信息，而不需要切换整个线程的上下文（M：N模型），减少了频繁切换的内存开销（切换）\n其实golang做的优化就是：原本每个任务都要对应一个线程，对于一个CPU来说遇到多任务并发执行的情况就要频繁切换线程（解决：等量M），并且需要从全局队列取任务，涉及到加解锁（解决：加P保存本地队列），造成资源的浪费。而 go 中只使用与机器 CPU 数量相等（默认）的线程，将相比线程更轻量的 goroutine 作为具体任务的执行载体，大部分情况下只需要通过处理器 P 和调度器在用户态进行调度，减少了线程切换带来的资源损耗。 go程序执行 go program：用户程序 runtime：runtime 是 Go 的运行时系统，它是一个在程序执行期间负责管理和支持 Go 语言特性的底层系统组件，用于支持 Goroutine 的调度、内存管理、垃圾回收、并发原语等关键功能。 Goroutine 的调度功能就是通过运行时中的 scheduler 实现的。\n调度器 scheduler 在程序运行过程中，runtime.schedt 对象只有一份实体，它负责协调和管理 goroutine 的执行。\n数据结构 runtime.schedt 结构体维护了空闲 M 列表、空闲 P 列表，全局 G 队列、dead G 缓存等等。\n所有 M 所有 P 所有 G 保存在全局变量中（allm, allp, allgs）， 调度器中只是空闲的列表 初始化 一些配置的初始化 获取 g0（ g0 在运行时系统启动时创建） 初始化 m0（初始化id以及gsignal等等） 【加锁】 初始化 GOMAXPROCS 个 P 【解锁】 关于 m0 和 g0 GMP M -\u0026gt; P -\u0026gt; G\nM：Machine，内核线程，即传统意义上的线程 P：Processor，处理器，运行在M上负责本地调度，减缓了全局锁的调用频率 G：Goroutine，待执行任务 G 只存在于 Go 语言的运行时，是用户态线程\n数据结构 runtime.g 结构体中包括使用的栈信息、当前绑定的M（可能为空）、抢占相关信息、调度相关信息等等\n状态 一个 G 最主要的生命周期可以概括为三个状态：\n阻塞中 例如：正在执行系统调用 _Gsyscall，运行时阻塞（channel之类的）_Gwaiting，被抢占 _Gpreempted 可运行 例如：存储在运行队列中 _Grunnable 运行中 例如：被赋予了M和P _Grunnable 此外，还有 GC 相关状态、初始化状态（_Gidle、_Gdead）等。 将空闲的G置为 _Gdead 状态可以避免 GC 扫描未初始化的栈（不知道啥意思，总之是和避免GC干啥有关）\n初始化 获取调用方 G 以及 PC；\n【锁住m0 避免抢占】用 g0 系统栈（systemstack）创建新的 G【解锁m0】（使用系统栈目的是减少栈帧的复制和管理开销，从而提高大型函数调用的性能）：\n获取 g0（启动时创建的）、p0（schedt初始化时创建） 尝试从本地或者全局 dead G 列表中获取空闲的 Goroutine (runtime.p.gFree, runtime.schedt.gFree)，如果没有空闲的则创建一个新的 G 设置其状态为 dead 并加入全局 G 列表 初始化 G 的运行现场以及需要的参数 放到运行队列中（本地p/全局schedt），根据传入的参数 next：\nnext 为 true：将 G 放到处理器的 p.runnext 上作为下一个执行的任务，如果 p.runnext 上原来有 G ，则把他踢到运行队列中； next 为 false：如果本地队列有空间则放本地，否则，就会把本地队列中的一部分 Goroutine 和待加入的 Goroutine 添加到调度器持有的全局运行队列上； 检查空闲的 P，如果有，将其唤醒（提高调度和执行效率）\nM 操作系统线程，调度器最多可以创建 10000 个线程，但是最多只会有当前机器内核数 GOMAXPROCS 个活跃线程能够正常运行。 运行时启动时不会一下创建内核数个M\n数据结构 runtime.m 结构体中包括了调度线程 g0 ，当前运行的goroutine curg 以及一些处理器相关字段、状态信息、调度相关信息等等\n状态 两种：自旋和非自旋 自旋的时候，会努力找工作（检查全局队列，查看 network poller，试图执行 gc 任务，或者“偷”工作）；找不到的时候会进入非自旋状态，之后会休眠，直到有工作需要处理时，被其他工作线程唤醒，又进入自旋状态。 初始化 创建时机：运行时系统启动时（创建m0、创建sysmon线程\u0026hellip;）、调度M去运行P时（没有空闲M则创建新的）\nruntime.newm 为创建新的M的顶层函数，执行了分配内存、初始化部分变量、调用底层函数新建操作系统线程等。\n由汇编语言调用 runtime.mstart 启动线程，初始化PC、SP和signal等运行现场，进入调度循环。\nP P 只是处理器的抽象，而非处理器本身。负责调度本地队列中的goroutine。\n数据结构 runtime.p 结构体反向存储着线程 m ，本地G队列（环形链表）、线程缓存（mcache）以及一些调试、GC 辅助的字段\n状态 一共有五个状态：\n_Pidle：P 处于空闲 _Prunning：被 M 持有，正在执行 _Psyscall：G 陷入系统调用 _Pgcstop：被 M 持有，由于 GC 被停止 _Pdead：由于 GOMAXPROCS shrank，当前 P 不再被使用 初始化 时机：运行时启动时，内核数变化时（很少见） runtime.procresize 负责p的初始化，调用时进入 world stopped 状态；\n根据新的内核数扩容或缩减 allp 全局p列表 扩容：申请新的P对象、做一些初始化操作 缩减：释放被缩减的P所持有的资源，并置其为 _Pdead 状态 判断当前G使用的P是否应该被释放（P在被缩减的范围内），如果是，则将当前P更换为 allp[0]； 遍历全局P列表 如果本地队列为空，则置为 _Pidle 状态，放入 schedt 调度器的空闲P列表 如果本地队列不为空，则绑定一个M，加入可运行的P链表 返回可运行的P链表 调度 触发调度的条件 根据 runtime.schedule 函数的调用方，可分为以下几类：\n线程启动 runtime.mstart 和 Goroutine 执行结束时 内存同步访问时（mutex，channel等阻塞时），主动挂起 系统调用时，G 对应的 M 和 P 也阻塞在系统调用，并不会立刻发生抢占，只有当这个阻塞持续时间过长（10 ms）时，才会将 P（及之上的其他 G）抢占并分配到空闲的 M 上 协作式调度，主动让出P，发生在G时间片耗尽 系统监控、GC等 调度循环 调度函数 runtime.schedule 是一个永不返回的函数，是由每个系统线程M的g0调用的，不断寻找待运行的G并执行，在G结束后会返回调度函数开头开始下一轮循环；\n如何寻找可运行的goroutine（序号为寻找优先级） 为保证公平，每61次调度将首先从调度器（runtime.sched）全局队列中获取G；取1个直接返回。 从p本地队列获取；取runnext，不行再取队首。 从全局队列获取；偷取的G数量最多为本地队列容量的一半，最少为全局队列中的G被每个P平分到的数量。 从netpoll获取； 从其他P偷取； 如果找不到，则将m切换至休眠状态，在切换期间还会一步三回头地再确认一遍确实没有可运行的G了； 步骤1和3都是从全局队列获取，但是步骤3会获取多个G，返回全局队列的队首G，剩下的放到P的本地队列中。 怎么偷 偷取 特指从其他P中获取G。 总共尝试四次，每次都会以随机的顺序遍历所有P，直到偷到。\n前三次会选择不在空闲状态的P（从空闲的P肯定获取不到G），如果队列中有G的话，会将一半的G偷到自己的本地队列里来；\n如果前三次都没偷到，最后一次会先看runnext位置上有没有G，再看本地队列，有就偷一个，还可能窃取处理器的计时器；\n怎么执行 偷到G以后，调用 runtime.execute 让G在M上跑起来\n绑定M和G，将G置为 _Grunning 状态 通过 runtime.gogo 将G调度到当前线程上，是由汇编指令实现的 G执行完成后，转换G状态为 _Gdead，解绑G/M，将G加入gFree列表，切换回g0开始新一轮的调度 总结一下 触发调度会将当前G切换回g0，由g0进行调度操作，待找到待运行的G后，将G切换到当前M上\nTODO

map变量实质 参数传递 传递基本类型时，会拷贝其值； 传递切片或数组时，会拷贝切片或数组中的所有值； 传递结构体时：会拷贝结构体中的全部内容； 传递结构体指针时：会拷贝结构体指针的值； slice数据结构 type SliceHeader struct { Data uintptr Len int Cap int } Data 是指向数组的指针; Len 是当前切片的长度； Cap 是当前切片的容量，即 Data 数组的大小： 原因 切片在函数参数中进行传递，相当于传递SliceHeader结构体，会拷贝结构体中的全部内容。\n根据索引进行修改时，会根据Data字段找到底层的数组并修改对应的值；由于函数内的切片sl和函数外的切片a虽然不是同一个SliceHeader结构体，但是其中的全部内容都相同，对data指向的底层数据进行修改会在两个结构体之间共享。\n而append不会影响函数外切片a的原因是，切片的数据是根据Data指向的首地址和Len圈定的范围共同决定的，无论函数内部如何append，外边原切片的Len是不变的，所以确定的底层数组长度也是不变的，添加到数组末尾的元素不在Len圈定的范围之内。\nmap变量实质 因为map、channel这两种类型的值其实是指向runtime.hmap与runtime.hchan的指针，而slice类型就是runtime.sliceHeader类型。\n根据上边代码中这一行输出可以看出：\nt.Log(unsafe.Sizeof(a), unsafe.Sizeof(m)) // 24 8 输出中24等于SliceHeader中三个字段大小之和，而8则对应着一个
