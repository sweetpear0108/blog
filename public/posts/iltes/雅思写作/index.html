Whatsmore, the choice is different in some fields by gender.\nOn the one hand, 68% of unemployed intent to do housework in morning, much higher than that in the afternoon, with only 28%. Shopping is another similar circumstance, 20% declined in the afternoon compare with 46% on first half of day. However, there is a exception, both men and women tend to watch TV in the afternoon, with 10% increasing along the day.\nOn the other hand, some arrangements are varied between men and women. 49% of women spent time on housework, while only 19% men interested in that. Opposite with housework, men showed more passion than women in gardening, 27% versus 5% in a whole day. At the same time, job hunting and sitting around have little difference in gender, separately within 6% and 3%.\nEvaluation: Task Achievement: 6.0 The candidate addresses the general topic of how unemployed people in the UK spent their time last year, distinguishing between activities preferred in the morning versus the afternoon and differences between gender. However, the response lacks overall clarity in presenting precise data comparison. Some statistical details mentioned do not relate directly to the task’s requirement to discuss the table effectively. The emphasis on time slots is appropriate, but a lack of clarity in summarizing and comparing critical data lowers the score.\nCoherence and Cohesion: 6.5 The structure of the essay shows a basic logical flow, distinguishing between morning activities and gender differences. However, the transitions between ideas are sometimes abrupt, and the linking phrases like “Whatsmore” and “On the one hand” are used awkwardly. The use of paragraphs is clear, but better cohesion could be achieved by smoother transitions and a clearer linkage between the data presented and the tasks outlined in the table.\nLexical Resource: 6.0 The use of vocabulary is adequate with terms like “intent”, “declined”, and “varied” appropriately used. Some phrases and word choices are awkward or incorrect (“intent” should be “intend”, “Whatsmore” is unconventional). There is a limited range of vocabulary to describe statistical data, and some repetition of words like “morning” and “afternoon” could be replaced with synonyms to enhance lexical range.\nGrammatical Range and Accuracy: 5.5 The response includes a mix of complex and simple sentences. There are several grammatical errors (“68% of unemployed intent to do housework” should be “intend”, “separately within 6% and 3%” is unclear and should be rephrased for clarity). These mistakes hinder the clarity and accuracy of the response. Punctuation is generally handled well, but sentence structure issues detract from the overall grammatical quality.\nOverall Remarks: The response provides a basic analysis of the table’s data concerning unemployed peoples’ time utilization in the UK, categorized by time of day and gender differences. Although it captures fundamental distinctions, it struggles with clarity in data presentation and accuracy in language use. The essay would benefit from fewer grammatical errors, a better range of vocabulary concerning data description, and improved logical sequencing of ideas for higher coherence. The overall grade reflects these areas of strength and needed improvements.\nOverall Grade: 6.0\nAI润色 The table illustrates how unemployed individuals in the UK spent their time last year. Overall, people tend to engage in activities more frequently in the morning than in the afternoon, such as housework, shopping, and job hunting. Furthermore, there are gender differences in activity preferences.\nOn one hand, 68% of unemployed individuals prefer doing housework in the morning, a much higher percentage compared to the afternoon, which stands at only 28%. A similar pattern is observed for shopping, with a 20% decrease in the afternoon compared to 46% in the first half of the day. However, there is an exception as both men and women tend to watch TV more in the afternoon, with a 10% increase as the day progresses.\nOn the other hand, there are variations in activity choices between men and women. For instance, 49% of women spend time on housework, whereas only 19% of men are interested in this activity. In contrast, men show a greater interest in gardening compared to women, with 27% versus 5% spending time on this activity throughout the day. Additionally, there is little difference in gender when it comes to job hunting and leisure time, with only a 6% and 3% variance, respectively.\nbar The bar chart below shows estimated world illiteracy rates by region and by gender for the last year.\nSummarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.\nThe graph illustrates assessed world illiteracy ratio of the last year by region and by gender.\nAs the chart shows, the percentage of the male without literacy was generally fewer than the female. In addition, the illiteracy proportion varied from different regions, the south asia became the highest while developed countries was the least.\nThe illiterated female citizens surpassed half of the same gender population in south asia, for the male was over 30% as well. Arab states and sub-saharan africa showed similarity in the percentage as south asia, about 40 percent of overall people in average. However, residents in developed countries had a significant low ratio, reaching almost zero. As for the two regions left, the data was under 20%.\nWhatsmore, the women without literacy rates was 10% higher in most of regions compared to men, especially in sub-saharan africa, exceeding over one-fifth. While there were merely difference by gender in developed countries and latin american/caribbean.\nEvaluation: Task Achievement: 6.0 The candidate’s response addresses the illiteracy ratio by region and gender and provides a comparison between male and female rates in different areas. The overall analysis captures the essence of the data presented in the graph, but the response lacks specific numerical details and clearer summarization. While the key points are covered, more precision in discussing the data and its significance is needed for a higher score.\nCoherence and Cohesion: 6.5 The response demonstrates a logical organization, moving from general trends to specific data points. Transition phrases like “As the chart shows” and “In addition” help connect ideas. However, some abrupt transitions and repetitive language (“Illiterated female citizens”) could be refined for better coherence. The response effectively uses paragraphs and maintains a central theme but could enhance cohesion with smoother transitions.\nLexical Resource: 6.0 The candidate employs suitable vocabulary, with terms like “illiteracy proportion” and “exceeding over one-fifth” conveying meaning effectively. However, there are instances of awkward phrasing and inaccuracies (“illiterated” should be “illiterate”), impacting lexical quality. More variety in word choice and idiomatic expressions could enhance the lexical resource, along with improved spelling and form use.\nGrammatical Range and Accuracy: 5.5 The response exhibits a mix of simple and complex sentences, showcasing some grammatical variety. However, there are several errors in grammar and phrasing (“the percentage of the male without literacy was generally fewer than the female” could be improved for clarity). While punctuation is generally correct, enhancements in sentence structure and precise language use are needed for better accuracy.\nOverall Remarks: The response effectively presents the illiteracy ratio data by region and gender, highlighting the disparities between male and female rates in various regions. Though the general trends are conveyed, the analysis could benefit from clearer articulation of numerical details and improved language accuracy. Enhancing vocabulary variety, addressing grammatical errors, and refining coherence would elevate the overall quality of the response.\nOverall Grade: 6.0\nAI润色 The graph illustrates the assessed world illiteracy rates from the previous year, categorized by region and gender. As the chart indicates, the percentage of illiterate males was generally lower than that of females. Furthermore, the illiteracy rates varied across different regions, with South Asia exhibiting the highest figures, while developed countries reported the lowest.\nIn South Asia, the proportion of illiterate female citizens surpassed half of the female population, with illiteracy among males exceeding 30% as well. The Arab states and Sub-Saharan Africa displayed similar illiteracy rates, averaging around 40% for both genders. In contrast, residents of developed countries had a significantly low illiteracy rate, approaching nearly zero. The two remaining regions recorded illiteracy rates below 20%.\nMoreover, the illiteracy rate among women was 10% higher than that of men in most regions, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa, where it exceeded one-fifth. However, there was minimal difference in illiteracy rates by gender in developed countries and the Latin American/Caribbean region.\nOverall, the data highlights the persistent gender disparity in literacy rates, particularly in less developed areas.\npie The two pie charts below show the marital status of the populations of Canada and Australia.\nSummarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.\nThe two pie charts illustrate the marital status of the citizens of Canada and Australia.\nOverall, the ‘Separated but not divorced’ and the ‘Married’ status occupy over 80% of populations in both countries, having difference in propotion according to the nation though.\nAs for Canada, the Separated but not divorced stands at 53%, exceeding 12% compared to the data in Australia. There is 29% of Canadian residents who were married, which is significantly lower than the one in Australia (46%). Whereas the sum of the two reachs to 82% and 87% separately, including most of population in the country. What’s more, Same sex marriage is shown in Canada singlely, containing 3% of total people.\nConcerning single people, 7% in Canada and 5% in Australia, revealing similarity in this type. Same as the single, the widowed (7% versus 6%) or the divorced population (1% versus 2%) has only 1% difference in both counties as well.\nEvaluation Task Achievement: 6.5 The response addresses the prompt by comparing the marital status of citizens in Canada and Australia. It presents relevant data and highlights key differences in proportions, particularly regarding the “Separated but not divorced” and “Married” categories. However, the analysis could be more comprehensive by providing clearer examples and a more detailed conclusion. While the main points are covered, the response lacks depth in discussing the implications of the statistics presented. Additionally, the mention of same-sex marriage in Canada is relevant but could be better integrated into the overall analysis. Overall, the response is focused on the topic but could benefit from a more thorough exploration of the data.\nCoherence and Cohesion: 6.0 The organization of ideas is generally logical, but the flow could be improved with clearer transitions between points. The use of cohesive devices is present but somewhat limited, leading to occasional abrupt shifts in topic. Paragraphing is not effectively utilized, as the response reads more like a continuous block of text rather than distinct sections. Each point could benefit from clearer topic sentences to guide the reader through the analysis. While the central theme is maintained, the lack of signposting language and varied sentence structures detracts from the overall coherence. More careful sequencing of ideas would enhance the clarity of the argument.\nLexical Resource: 6.5 The vocabulary used is appropriate, and there is a reasonable range of terms related to marital status. However, some phrases are repetitive, and the response could benefit from a broader use of synonyms to avoid redundancy. The candidate demonstrates an understanding of academic vocabulary, but there are instances where word choices could be more precise or varied. Although the language is generally clear, there are moments where idiomatic expressions or more sophisticated terms could enhance the overall quality. The spelling is mostly accurate, but the occasional awkward phrasing detracts from the overall impression.\nGrammatical Range and Accuracy: 6.0 The grammatical structures used in the response are mostly correct, with a mix of simple and complex sentences. However, there are a few grammatical errors, such as subject-verb agreement and punctuation issues, that affect the overall clarity. The candidate demonstrates an understanding of verb tenses, but there are instances of awkward phrasing that suggest a lack of fluency in more complex structures. While the response is generally understandable, the presence of minor errors indicates a need for further refinement in grammatical accuracy. More varied sentence structures would improve the overall quality and showcase a greater range of grammatical ability.\nOverall Grade: 6.0 The overall score reflects a balanced assessment of the candidate’s performance across all criteria. While the response demonstrates a good understanding of the task and presents relevant information, there are areas for improvement in coherence, vocabulary variety, and grammatical accuracy. A more structured approach and careful attention to detail would enhance the overall quality of the response.\nAI润色 The two pie charts illustrate the marital status of citizens in Canada and Australia. Overall, the categories of “Separated but not divorced” and “Married” account for over 80% of the populations in both countries, although there are differences in proportions between the two nations.\nIn Canada, the percentage of individuals who are “Separated but not divorced” stands at 53%, which exceeds the corresponding figure in Australia by 12%. Meanwhile, 29% of Canadian residents are married, significantly lower than the 46% observed in Australia. The combined total of these two categories reaches 82% in Canada and 87% in Australia, representing a substantial portion of the population in each country. Additionally, same-sex marriage is uniquely represented in Canada, comprising 3% of the total population.\nRegarding single individuals, 7% of Canadians are single compared to 5% of Australians, indicating a similarity in this demographic. Similarly, the percentages of widowed individuals (7% in Canada versus 6% in Australia) and divorced individuals (1% in Canada versus 2% in Australia) show only a 1% difference between the two countries.\n动态图 line The graph below gives information about the percentage of the population in four Asian countries living in cities from 1970 to 2020, with predictions for 2030 and 2040.\nSummarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.\nThe line graph shows the percentage of people who live in cities in four Asian nations between 1970 and 2020, and predicts the data in 2030 and 2040.\nOverall, population in all four countires have increased more or few comparing with 50 years ago and the growing trend will be continued until 20 years later at least.\nIn 1970s, urban citizens in Thailand and Indonesia are under one fifth of total number, while the data are little bit higher in Philippines and Malaysia, around 30%. After 50 years development, population in cities of Malaysia have reached over 80%, which is the highest among the four. As Indonesia, which is the least one, raised rapidly over years and surpassed Philippines and Thailand after 2010.\nWith the prediction, the proportion of urban citizens will continuously increase after 2020, and Malaysia will keep it leading position. The urban population of all four countries will exceed a half amount in 2040.\nEvaluation: Task Achievement: 6.5 The candidate provides a clear overview of the line graph, addressing the main trends in urban population growth across four Asian nations from 1970 to 2020, along with predictions for 2030 and 2040. However, while the response mentions key data points, it lacks specific numerical details that would enhance the analysis. The statement about Malaysia having the highest urban population is accurate, but the comparison with Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand could be more explicitly detailed. Overall, the response captures the essence of the task but could benefit from more precise data references and a clearer summary of trends.\nCoherence and Cohesion: 6.0 The structure of the response is generally logical, with a clear progression from past data to future predictions. However, the use of cohesive devices is somewhat limited, and transitions between ideas could be smoother. Phrases like “In 1970s” and “After 50 years development” could be better integrated into the flow of the text. The candidate uses paragraphs effectively, but clearer signposting would improve the overall coherence of the response.\nLexical Resource: 6.5 The vocabulary used is appropriate for the task, with terms like “urban citizens,” “population,” and “predictions” effectively conveying the intended meaning. However, there are instances of awkward phrasing, such as “under one fifth of total number” and “little bit higher,” which detract from the overall quality. The candidate demonstrates a reasonable range of vocabulary but could enhance their lexical resource by incorporating more varied expressions and avoiding repetition.\nGrammatical Range and Accuracy: 6.0 The response includes a mix of simple and complex sentences, demonstrating a fair range of grammatical structures. However, there are several grammatical errors, such as “the population in all four countries have increased more or few” (should be “more or less”) and “the data are little bit higher” (should be “a little bit higher”). These errors affect clarity and accuracy. Punctuation is generally correct, but some sentences could be restructured for better grammatical precision.\nOverall Remarks: The response effectively summarizes the trends in urban population growth in four Asian nations, providing a clear overview of the data presented in the line graph. While it captures the main points, the analysis would benefit from more specific numerical references, improved cohesion, and greater grammatical accuracy. The overall grade reflects these strengths and areas for improvement.\nOverall Grade: 6.0\nAI润色 The line graph illustrates the percentage of urban residents in four Asian nations from 1970 to 2020, with projections for 2030 and 2040.\nOverall, the urban population has increased in all four countries compared to 50 years ago, and this upward trend is expected to continue for at least the next 20 years.\nIn the 1970s, the proportion of urban dwellers in Thailand and Indonesia was less than one-fifth of the total population, slightly higher in the Philippines and Malaysia at around 30%. Over the 50-year period, Malaysia’s urban population surged to over 80%, the highest among the four countries. Indonesia, initially the lowest, experienced rapid growth and surpassed the Philippines and Thailand after 2010.\nLooking ahead, the percentage of urban residents is projected to keep rising after 2020, with Malaysia maintaining its leading position. By 2040, the urban population in all four nations is anticipated to exceed half of the total population.\n流程图 The diagram below shows how glass is recycled.\nSummarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.\nThe flow chart depicts the recycled process of glass.\nConsumers always buy drinks from supermarket, the useless glass bottle is disposed to the recycle bin at most of time. The recycled litter would be collected and sent to treatment plant by specified staff in a period. Washing and sterilising process would apply on the first step, in order to strip down the dirt and other harmful stuff in the bottle.\nThe glass will be crushed into pieces then through into melting machine. The high temperature will reshape the bottle into liquad glass and kill all bectiria remained. Then there is regeneration step, the raw material will be moulded into different shape depends on the accomodation. In final, the goods with glass container will be delivered to the supermarket for selling.\nThe 6 graph in flow chart illustrates the life of the recycled glass bottle, reborn times by times for the sake of these professional and effective processes.\nEvaluation: Task Achievement: 5.5 The response describes the process of glass recycling and the steps involved in transforming glass bottles back into new products. However, there are some inaccuracies and missing details in the explanation, such as the specific temperature of the melting machine, the duration of each step, and the environmental impact of the process. The response partially addresses the prompt but lacks comprehensive details and precision. Coherence and Cohesion: 6.0 The flow of ideas is somewhat logical, with a clear progression from the initial disposal of glass bottles to the final product delivery. However, there are instances of unclear sequencing and abrupt transitions between steps. The transition phrases are limited, and the organization could be improved for better coherence and cohesion.\nLexical Resource: 5.5 The vocabulary used is basic and lacks variety in describing the recycling process. The terminology related to recycling, such as “washing and sterilizing,” “melting machine,” and “regeneration step,” is employed, but there is a lack of sophisticated vocabulary and technical terms that would enhance the explanation. More precise and specific language related to the recycling industry would improve the lexical resource.\nGrammatical Range and Accuracy: 5.0 The response contains a mix of simple and complex sentence structures but is marred by several grammatical errors and inaccuracies. Phrases like “reshape the bottle into liquad glass” and “kill all bectiria remained” contain spelling and grammatical mistakes. Additionally, some sentences lack clarity and coherence, affecting the overall grammatical quality of the response.\nOverall Remarks: The response describes the glass recycling process but lacks depth and accuracy in explaining the steps involved. To enhance the quality of the explanation, the candidate should provide more specific details, correct the grammatical errors, and use a wider range of vocabulary related to recycling technology. Improving coherence, precision, and vocabulary use would significantly elevate the overall quality of the response.\nOverall Grade: 5.5\nAI润色 This flow chart illustrates the recycling process of glass.\nConsumers typically purchase beverages from supermarkets, and the empty glass bottles are usually discarded in recycling bins. The collected glass waste is then transported to a treatment plant by designated personnel. The initial steps involve washing and sterilizing the glass to remove dirt and other contaminants.\nSubsequently, the glass is crushed into pieces and fed into a melting machine where high temperatures melt the glass into a liquid state, effectively eliminating any remaining bacteria. The next phase involves the regeneration process, where the molten glass is molded into various shapes as per requirements. Finally, the glass products, including containers, are packaged and delivered to supermarkets for sale.\nThe flow chart outlines a cyclical process of glass recycling, highlighting the repeated cycles of rebirth for glass bottles through these efficient and specialized procedures.\n地图 The two maps below show the changes that have taken place in the town of Westley since 1815.\nSummarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.\nThe two graphs depict the changes in the town of Westley from 1815.\nIn the past, there was a bridge named ‘Twine Toll Bridge’ in the eastnorthen of the town acrossing the river, providing the only way to London. Along the winding road, there was a church in the central of the town, which beside it is the Lenton Woods. Residential area was settled in the south of the woods, including Market Square, Town hall and Houses. At the end of the road located the fields.\nA significant change have taken place in the last hundreds of years. A railway have built in the eastern, acrossing the fields before and replacing the old bridge, which connects Westley to other place. Lenton Housing Estate is located in the place where the Woods before. Whatsmore, the road is extended to northen area with a train station in the corner.\nOverall, Westley has advanced a lot with more modern facilities than the old time.\nEvaluation: Task Achievement: 6.5 The candidate effectively describes the changes in the town of Westley from 1815 using the provided information. The response covers the historical presence of ‘Twine Toll Bridge,’ the church, Lenton Woods, and the residential area accurately. The mention of the railway development and subsequent changes in the eastern region provides a clear depiction of the town’s evolution. The focus on significant alterations over time demonstrates an understanding of the data presented in the two graphs. However, providing more specific details about the town’s transformation and emphasizing key historical landmarks could enhance the task achievement score. Coherence and Cohesion: 6.5 The response features a logical and coherent structure, outlining the town’s changes in chronological order. Transition phrases like ‘In the past’ and ‘A significant change’ help connect different time periods and developments. While the progression is clear, some abrupt transitions could be smoothened for better coherence. The central theme of urban development and modernization is maintained throughout the response.\nLexical Resource: 6.0 The vocabulary usage in the response is adequate, with terms like ‘Lenton Housing Estate’ and ‘Market Square’ effectively describing the town’s features. However, there are instances of repetitive language and a lack of variety in vocabulary, such as repeatedly using ’eastern’ and ’northen. More diverse word choices and greater precision in describing historical landmarks could improve the lexical resource.\nGrammatical Range and Accuracy: 6.0 The candidate demonstrates a mix of simple and complex sentence structures, providing a clear description of the town’s transformation. While grammatical errors are minimal, some sentences could be refined for better accuracy and clarity. Improvements in sentence structure and word order could enhance the response’s overall quality.\nOverall Remarks: The response effectively depicts the changes in the town of Westley over time, capturing key developments from 1815 to modern days. The historical evolution of landmarks like the bridge and church, along with the introduction of the railway and modern facilities, is well articulated. Enhancements in vocabulary variety, smoother transitions between ideas, and increased precision in language use would elevate the response.\nOverall Grade: 6.0\nAI润色 The two graphs depict the changes in the town of Westley from 1815. In the past, a bridge named ‘Twine Toll Bridge’ was situated in the northeastern part of the town, crossing the river and serving as the primary route to London. Along the winding road, there stood a church at the town’s center, adjacent to Lenton Woods. The residential area was established to the south of the woods, comprising Market Square, the Town Hall, and residential houses, with fields marking the end of the road.\nSignificant changes have taken place over the past centuries. A railway was constructed in the east, crossing the fields and replacing the old bridge, providing a new connection for Westley to other areas. Lenton Housing Estate now occupies the former location of the woods. Additionally, the road has been extended to the northern area, featuring a train station at the corner.\nOverall, Westley has undergone substantial development, introducing more modern facilities compared to its earlier days.\nThe plans below show a harbour in 2000 and how it looks today.\nSummarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.\nThe graphs depict the change of Porth Harbour between 2000 and today.\nAs the first map shown, the main road constructed in the west of the harbour. Car parks and toilets were right beside the road. At the end of the road which branched from the main road in southern, was the lifeboal which is located in front of the public beach. A disused castle was left in the southeastern corner. The dock is on northern of the sea, with the passenger ferries in the water.\nNowadays, A private yachis named ‘Marina’ in the southwest of the coast replaces the fishing boats before. Additionally, an extra showers and toilets are built on the left hand of it. The new building on the right hand of Marina is Cafes and shops. What’s more, a hotle is settled instead of the disposed castle, changing the beach aside it to private use for guest.\nOverall, the harbour has few changes in decades as a result of the development of tourism.\nTask Achievement: 5.0 The response addresses the prompt by describing the changes in Porth Harbour from 2000 to the present. However, it lacks depth in presenting a clear position or viewpoint. The details provided are somewhat relevant but could benefit from a more structured approach to highlighting significant changes. The description of the harbour’s features is somewhat vague and lacks specific examples that would enhance the analysis. Additionally, the conclusion is weak, failing to effectively summarize the key points or provide insight into the implications of these changes. Overall, while the task is addressed, the response could be more comprehensive and focused to achieve a higher score.\nCoherence and Cohesion: 5.5 The organization of ideas is somewhat logical, but there are issues with coherence. The transition between different features of the harbour is abrupt, which can confuse the reader. While some cohesive devices are used, they are not consistently applied, leading to a lack of fluidity in the writing. The response could benefit from clearer topic sentences and signposting language to guide the reader through the various changes. Additionally, the sequencing of ideas could be improved to create a more cohesive narrative. Overall, while there is a basic structure, the response lacks the necessary coherence to achieve a higher score.\nLexical Resource: 5.5 The vocabulary used in the response is adequate but lacks variety and precision. There are instances of repetitive language, which detracts from the overall quality of the writing. Some phrases, such as “extra showers and toilets,” could be expressed more elegantly to enhance clarity. While there is an attempt to use relevant terms related to the topic, the lack of synonyms and paraphrasing limits the lexical range. Additionally, there are occasional spelling errors, such as “hotle,” which further undermine the quality of the vocabulary. Overall, while the lexical resource is functional, it could be significantly improved with a broader range of vocabulary and more precise language.\nGrammatical Range and Accuracy: 5.0 The grammatical structures used in the response are generally correct, but there are several errors that affect clarity. For instance, phrases like “the lifeboal which is located” contain spelling mistakes that detract from the overall quality. Additionally, there are issues with sentence structure, as some sentences are overly simplistic or lack complexity. The use of verb tenses is mostly appropriate, but there are instances where the tense shifts create confusion. Punctuation is generally correct, but the writing could benefit from more varied sentence structures to enhance grammatical range. Overall, while the response demonstrates a basic understanding of grammar, the errors present hinder its effectiveness.\nOverall Grade: 5.0 The average of the scores across all criteria results in an overall grade of 5.0. The response addresses the task but lacks depth and clarity in several areas. Improvements in coherence, vocabulary variety, and grammatical accuracy could elevate the score significantly. The writing demonstrates potential but requires more careful organization and attention to detail to achieve a higher band score.\nAI润色 The graphs illustrate the changes at Porth Harbour between 2000 and today. In the first map, a main road was constructed in the west of the harbour, with car parks and toilets located right beside it. At the end of the road, which branches off from the main road to the south, lies the lifeboat station situated in front of the public beach. A disused castle remains in the southeastern corner, while the dock is located to the north of the sea, accommodating passenger ferries.\nIn the present day, a private yacht marina has replaced the former fishing boats in the southwest of the coast. Additionally, extra showers and toilets have been built to the left of the marina. On the right side, new cafes and shops have been established. Furthermore, a hotel has been constructed in place of the abandoned castle, converting the adjacent beach into a private area for guests.\nOverall, the harbour has undergone a few changes over the decades, primarily due to the development of tourism.\n两张图 The line graph and pie chart below show information on crime in the UK for the last year.\nSummarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.\nThe line chart and pie graph illustrate the relation between age and crime and types of crime in the UK last year separately.\nAs the line chart shows, there was a difference in crime rate varies from ages. Concerning children who were under 8 years old, there was no crime happend regarding the innocence in this age. The percentage surged up to 80% when crime age reached 20. Then the rates decreased according to the age, entering stable stage (below 20%) after age 28.\nThe pie chart catagorized crime into four types: violent, property, drug, and public order. Violent crime stood at the leading position, with 46% of total count. While public order type only occupied 9%. The remaining two types were over 10% higher than the former one, reaching about one-fifth separately.\nOverall, the crime rate stayed at high level during the young age, prioring in the violent commitment.\ntask 2 观点（二选一） The most important aim of science should be to improve people’s lives.\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?\nThere is a statement claim that we should view improving people’s lives as the most important aim of science. I strongly agree with it for three aspects in economy, ethical problem and feasibility.\nFirst of all, enonomy influences both our lives and science. Over last a hundred year, human society evoluted rapidly with the assistance of science, which brings a numerous amount of fortunes to all people in the world. As the result, with the substaintial money created with high productivity, scientist have a better condition for research, which can be help them to make a further step in science.\nBesides, ethical issues should be took into consideration. Science is a double sword, if we can not estimate the influence, it will bring disaster to human. As we all know, the initial usage of bomb is for road creating through mountains. Unfortunately, it becomes a killer in war with the abuse using, brings millions of death and sorrow for family. So we must keep ‘improving human’s lives’ as the main aim of science.\nSome people may think we should develop science as fast as we can no matter what. However, take the one under control and keep the aim on benefiting human is a more feasible way. We can gather strength and motivation effectively under a clear direction, just like driving on the express way.\nIn short, I believe the first and foremost aim of science is to benefit people. We should take science as an assistant for us rather than serving it. Science without people is nothing.\nEvaluation: Task Achievement: 6.5 The candidate strongly agrees with the statement regarding the importance of improving people’s lives as the primary goal of science. The response addresses the three aspects of economy, ethical issues, and feasibility to support this viewpoint. The candidate effectively presents a clear position and develops ideas coherently and logically. Relevant examples and evidence are provided to strengthen the argument. However, some parts of the response could be more refined to fully answer the question and avoid repetition. While the conclusion is effective, a more comprehensive analysis of the statement’s implications would enhance the score.\nCoherence and Cohesion: 6.5 The response is structured logically, with a clear introduction, body, and conclusion discussing the various aspects of the statement. Transition phrases like “First of all,” “Besides,” and “In short” help guide the reader through the argument. The paragraphs are well-organized, but some sentences could be more succinct for better cohesion. Maintaining the central theme and ensuring each paragraph has a clear topic sentence would strengthen coherence.\nLexical Resource: 6.0 The vocabulary used is generally appropriate, with terms like “fortunes,” “feasibility,” and “substantial money” effectively conveying the candidate’s ideas. However, there are instances of awkward phrasing (“evoluted rapidly”) and grammatical errors that impact the lexical quality. More precise and accurate vocabulary choices could enhance the overall lexical resource, along with increased variety and idiomatic expressions.\nGrammatical Range and Accuracy: 5.5 The response includes a mix of simple and complex sentence structures, demonstrating an attempt at grammatical variety. However, there are several grammatical errors throughout the response, such as “enonomy” (economy), “substaintial” (substantial), and “be took” (be taken), affecting clarity and accuracy. Punctuation use is adequate, but improvements in sentence structure and grammatical precision are needed for a higher score.\nOverall Remarks: The response effectively argues for considering the improvement of people’s lives as the central aim of science, with supporting points related to economy, ethics, and feasibility. While the response is well-structured and coherent, there are areas for improvement in the clarity and accuracy of language use, as well as grammatical precision. Enhancing vocabulary range and addressing grammatical errors would elevate the overall quality of the response.\nOverall Grade: 6.0\nAI润色 There is a statement that we should view improving people’s lives as the most important aim of science. I strongly agree with this for three reasons: economic impact, ethical considerations, and feasibility.\nFirst of all, the economy significantly influences both our lives and the field of science. Over the last hundred years, human society has evolved rapidly with the assistance of scientific advancements, generating substantial wealth for people worldwide. As a result, with the substantial financial resources created through high productivity, scientists have better conditions for research, enabling them to make further advancements in their fields.\nFurthermore, ethical issues must be taken into consideration. Science is a double-edged sword; if we cannot assess its consequences, it can lead to disastrous outcomes for humanity. For instance, the original purpose of explosives was to facilitate road construction through mountains. Unfortunately, these same explosives have been weaponized in warfare, leading to millions of deaths and immense sorrow for countless families. Therefore, we must prioritize “improving human lives” as the primary aim of science.\nSome may argue that we should advance science as rapidly as possible, regardless of the consequences. However, maintaining control and focusing on benefiting humanity is a more feasible approach. With a clear direction, we can effectively harness our collective strength and motivation, much like driving on a well-maintained expressway.\nIn conclusion, I believe the foremost aim of science should be to benefit people. We should view science as an ally rather than something to be served. After all, science without humanity is meaningless.\nThe working week should be shorter and workers should have a longer weekend.\nDo you agree or disagree?\nThere is an arguement about the days of the working week and the weekend. I strongly agree with the view that the working time should be shorter and more weekend time should be left to workers. It can be discussed in 3 reasons: working efficiency, mental health of workers, and economy influency.\nHaving more relax time would increase the efficiency in working. The weekend is not only a time for entertainment, but also a chance to have a rest. As we known, individuals should be 100% concentrated and devoted into work from Monday to Friday, which is a really tough thing. As a research, efficiency falls rapidly after 45 minutes focusing, showing that a break is nessesary. Same with working, having a good rest in weekend will benifit the efficiency of the workers, a longer weekend will definetly impact it.\nIndividuals mental health is another issue. A dull life without relaxing can cause the mental disease occasionally. As a human, we have feelings, which is complex and needs a way to regulate by outselves. A relax would be the best medicine with no doubt.\nSome persons may think a shorter working time would bring side effect to the economy. However, people would do other things in the weekend as well, such as visiting museum, watching movie, shopping and so on. All of things would encourage the grown of the economy.\nIn conclusion, a shorter working week will benifits both society and individual.\nEvaluation Task Achievement: 6.5 The response adequately addresses the argument about reducing working hours and increasing weekend time for workers. The candidate clearly states agreement with the view and supports this with three reasons: working efficiency, mental health, and economic influence. Each aspect is discussed to some degree, but the support could be strengthened with more detailed evidence or data, particularly in areas like efficiency and economic impact. The response touches on relevant points but would benefit from deeper analysis and stronger conclusions drawn from more concrete examples or statistics to thoroughly answer the prompt and fully cover all parts of the task.\nCoherence and Cohesion: 6.0 The essay is structured with a clear introduction, body paragraphs for each argument, and a conclusion, which aids in maintaining a coherent flow of ideas. However, transitions between ideas feel somewhat abrupt at times, and the linkage between the main thesis and supporting points could be smoother. The use of cohesive devices like “however” and “as a result” is appropriate but limited. More varied and effective use of these devices could enhance the logical flow of the essay and help better connect the points to the overall argument.\nLexical Resource: 6.0 The vocabulary is generally appropriate, with specific terms like “efficiency,” “mental health,” and “economic influence” adequately used. However, the lexical range is somewhat limited, and there are instances of awkward or incorrect word choices (“grown” instead of “growth,” “benifit” instead of “benefit”). Expanding the vocabulary with more precise and varied language would strengthen the essay. Moreover, the candidate should focus on accurate spelling and correct use of words to improve the lexical resource score.\nGrammatical Range and Accuracy: 5.5 The grammatical range is somewhat limited, primarily consisting of simple and some compound structures. While the response includes attempts at complex sentences, there are frequent grammatical errors that impede clarity, such as issues with verb forms (“benifits” should be “benefits”), and preposition use. Improving sentence variety and correcting grammatical mistakes would enhance the clarity and sophistication of the essay.\nOverall Remarks: The response presents a clear argument in favor of more weekend time and shorter working weeks, with reasons centered around efficiency, mental health, and economic benefits. While the ideas are relevant and the structure is clear, the execution could be improved with better cohesion, a richer lexical resource, and more accurate grammar. Enhancements in these areas would provide a stronger, more compelling argument.\nOverall Grade: 6.0 This grade reflects an essay that meets the basic requirements of the task with some coherence and relevance but needs improvements in detail, lexical range, and grammatical accuracy to achieve a higher score.\nAI润色 There is an argument about the days of the working week and the weekend. I strongly agree with the view that the working time should be shorter and more weekend time should be allocated to workers. This can be discussed for three reasons: working efficiency, workers’ mental health, and its impact on the economy. Having more relaxation time would increase efficiency at work. The weekend is not just for entertainment but also a crucial time for rest. It is well-known that individuals need to be fully concentrated and dedicated to work from Monday to Friday, which can be challenging. Research shows that efficiency declines rapidly after 45 minutes of focusing, highlighting the necessity of breaks. Similarly, having a good rest on the weekend would benefit workers’ efficiency, and a longer weekend would certainly have a positive impact.\nMental health is another critical aspect. A monotonous life without relaxation can lead to mental health issues. Being human, we have complex emotions that need self-regulation. Relaxation is indeed the best medicine for maintaining mental well-being.\nSome individuals may believe that a shorter working week could have negative effects on the economy. However, people engage in various activities over the weekend, such as visiting museums, watching movies, and shopping. All of these activities contribute to the growth of the economy.\nIn conclusion, a shorter working week would benefit both society and individuals.\nproblem and solution Some species of animals are almost extinct; and many others seem to be fast approaching a similar risk. What are the reasons for this? What should be done to solve this problem?\nGive reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge and experience.\nSome of the animals are endangered nowadays, while many others are facing ectinction. There are many reasons, such as the human activity, climate change, and the flaw of genes. People should take actions to eliminate the aggravation of this problem. On the one hand, humanity intrusion is one of the biggest factor of the extinction. Many forests were cut off due to the either the living requirement or the economy profits. For instance, the amazon rainforest is demolished in the significant speed every year, bringing disaster for the species living in it. The quantity of the specie is decline for this issue which leads to the extinction. Besides, the climate change is another important cause. As the temperature increase, the water becomes warm than before which would affect the original residents like turtles or sharks in the sea. Some fishes relocate to new place where more suitable for the living, which brings a lack of food resources for the species preying them. Although humanity can not revert the climate change trend, which is a nature regulation, they can slow the process down in some extend by controlling the generation fo carbon-dioxide, eliminating the pollution, conserving the habitat and so on. The relative division should formulate the management to keep the original habitat staying away from the abusing use of company or government. Overall, protect animals is the responsibility of each individual. We should contribute as much as we can to prevent some species going to extinction. Animals are the priceless treasure of the earth.\n","wordCount":"7551","inLanguage":"zh","datePublished":"2024-10-06T18:51:00+08:00","dateModified":"2024-10-06T18:51:00+08:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"sweetpear"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http://localhost:40585/posts/iltes/%E9%9B%85%E6%80%9D%E5%86%99%E4%BD%9C/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Sweetpear's Blog","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"http://localhost:40585/icon.png"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=http://localhost:40585/ accesskey=h title="Sweetpear's Blog (Alt + H)"><img src=http://localhost:40585/icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Sweetpear's Blog</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=http://localhost:40585/archives/ title=归档><span>归档</span></a></li><li><a href=http://localhost:40585/tags/ title=标签><span>标签</span></a></li><li><a href=http://localhost:40585/search/ title="搜索 (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>搜索</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=http://localhost:40585/>主页</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=http://localhost:40585/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">雅思写作练习记录</h1><div class=post-description>初稿、ai评分、ai润色</div><div class=post-meta><span title='2024-10-06 18:51:00 +0800 CST'>2024-10-06</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;sweetpear&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/sweetpear0108/blog/tree/main/content/posts/ILTES/%e9%9b%85%e6%80%9d%e5%86%99%e4%bd%9c.MD rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>修改建议</a></div></header><div class=toc><details><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>目录</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#静态图>静态图</a><ul><li><a href=#table>table</a></li><li><a href=#bar>bar</a></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><a href=#动态图>动态图</a><ul><li><a href=#line>line</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#流程图>流程图</a></li><li><a href=#地图>地图</a></li><li><a href=#两张图>两张图</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href=#观点二选一>观点（二选一）</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><h1 id=task-1>task 1<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#task-1>#</a></h1><h2 id=静态图>静态图<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#静态图>#</a></h2><h3 id=table>table<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#table>#</a></h3><p><strong>The table below shows how the UK unemployed spent their time last year.</strong></p><p><strong>Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.</strong></p><p><em>The table illustrates the things unemployed spent time on last year in UK.</em></p><p><em>Overall, people prefer handling stuff in morning rather than afternoon, such as doing housework, shopping and job hunting.

There are many reasons, such as the human activity, climate change, and the flaw of genes. People should take actions to eliminate the aggravation of this problem.
On the one hand, humanity intrusion is one of the biggest factor of the extinction. Many forests were cut off due to the either the living requirement or the economy profits. For instance, the amazon rainforest is demolished in the significant speed every year, bringing disaster for the species living in it. The quantity of the specie is decline for this issue which leads to the extinction. Besides, the climate change is another important cause. As the temperature increase, the water becomes warm than before which would affect the original residents like turtles or sharks in the sea. Some fishes relocate to new place where more suitable for the living, which brings a lack of food resources for the species preying them.
Although humanity can not revert the climate change trend, which is a nature regulation, they can slow the process down in some extend by controlling the generation fo carbon-dioxide, eliminating the pollution, conserving the habitat and so on. The relative division should formulate the management to keep the original habitat staying away from the abusing use of company or government.
Overall, protect animals is the responsibility of each individual. We should contribute as much as we can to prevent some species going to extinction. Animals are the priceless treasure of the earth.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=http://localhost:40585/tags/%E9%9B%85%E6%80%9D/>雅思</a></li><li><a href=http://localhost:40585/tags/%E9%9B%85%E6%80%9D%E5%86%99%E4%BD%9C/>雅思写作</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=http://localhost:40585/posts/iltes/corpus/><span class=title>« 上一页</span><br><span>雅思写作口语语料库</span>
