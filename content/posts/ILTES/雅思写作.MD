__The table below shows how the UK unemployed spent their time last year.__

__Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.__

_The table illustrates the things unemployed spent time on last year in UK._

_Overall, people prefer handling stuff in morning rather than afternoon, such as doing housework, shopping and job hunting. Whatsmore, the choice is different in some fields by gender._

_On the one hand, 68% of unemployed intent to do housework in morning, much higher than that in the afternoon, with only 28%. Shopping is another similar circumstance, 20% declined in the afternoon compare with 46% on first half of day. However, there is a exception, both men and women tend to watch TV in the afternoon, with 10% increasing along the day._

_On the other hand, some arrangements are varied between men and women. 49% of women spent time on housework, while only 19% men interested in that. Opposite with housework, men showed more passion than women in gardening, 27% versus 5% in a whole day. At the same time, job hunting and sitting around have little difference in gender, separately within 6% and 3%._

* Evaluation:

Task Achievement: 6.0 The candidate addresses the general topic of how unemployed people in the UK spent their time last year, distinguishing between activities preferred in the morning versus the afternoon and differences between gender. However, the response lacks overall clarity in presenting precise data comparison. Some statistical details mentioned do not relate directly to the task's requirement to discuss the table effectively. The emphasis on time slots is appropriate, but a lack of clarity in summarizing and comparing critical data lowers the score.

Coherence and Cohesion: 6.5 The structure of the essay shows a basic logical flow, distinguishing between morning activities and gender differences. However, the transitions between ideas are sometimes abrupt, and the linking phrases like "Whatsmore" and "On the one hand" are used awkwardly. The use of paragraphs is clear, but better cohesion could be achieved by smoother transitions and a clearer linkage between the data presented and the tasks outlined in the table.

Lexical Resource: 6.0 The use of vocabulary is adequate with terms like "intent", "declined", and "varied" appropriately used. Some phrases and word choices are awkward or incorrect ("intent" should be "intend", "Whatsmore" is unconventional). There is a limited range of vocabulary to describe statistical data, and some repetition of words like "morning" and "afternoon" could be replaced with synonyms to enhance lexical range.

Grammatical Range and Accuracy: 5.5 The response includes a mix of complex and simple sentences. There are several grammatical errors ("68% of unemployed intent to do housework" should be "intend", "separately within 6% and 3%" is unclear and should be rephrased for clarity). These mistakes hinder the clarity and accuracy of the response. Punctuation is generally handled well, but sentence structure issues detract from the overall grammatical quality.

Overall Remarks:
The response provides a basic analysis of the table's data concerning unemployed peoples' time utilization in the UK, categorized by time of day and gender differences. Although it captures fundamental distinctions, it struggles with clarity in data presentation and accuracy in language use. The essay would benefit from fewer grammatical errors, a better range of vocabulary concerning data description, and improved logical sequencing of ideas for higher coherence. The overall grade reflects these areas of strength and needed improvements.

Overall Grade: 6.0

_The table illustrates how unemployed individuals in the UK spent their time last year. Overall, people tend to engage in activities more frequently in the morning than in the afternoon, such as housework, shopping, and job hunting. Furthermore, there are gender differences in activity preferences._

_On one hand, 68% of unemployed individuals prefer doing housework in the morning, a much higher percentage compared to the afternoon, which stands at only 28%. A similar pattern is observed for shopping, with a 20% decrease in the afternoon compared to 46% in the first half of the day. However, there is an exception as both men and women tend to watch TV more in the afternoon, with a 10% increase as the day progresses._

_On the other hand, there are variations in activity choices between men and women. For instance, 49% of women spend time on housework, whereas only 19% of men are interested in this activity. In contrast, men show a greater interest in gardening compared to women, with 27% versus 5% spending time on this activity throughout the day. Additionally, there is little difference in gender when it comes to job hunting and leisure time, with only a 6% and 3% variance, respectively._

__Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.__

_The line graph shows the percentage of people who live in cities in four Asian nations between 1970 and 2020, and predicts the data in 2030 and 2040._

_Overall, population in all four countires have increased more or few comparing with 50 years ago and the growing trend will be continued until 20 years later at least._

_In 1970s, urban citizens in Thailand and Indonesia are under one fifth of total number, while the data are little bit higher in Philippines and Malaysia, around 30%. After 50 years development, population in cities of Malaysia have reached over 80%, which is the highest among the four. As Indonesia, which is the least one, raised rapidly over years and surpassed Philippines and Thailand after 2010._

_With the prediction, the proportion of urban citizens will continuously increase  after 2020, and Malaysia will keep it leading position. The urban population  of all four countries will exceed a half amount in 2040._


* Evaluation:

Task Achievement: 6.5
The candidate provides a clear overview of the line graph, addressing the main trends in urban population growth across four Asian nations from 1970 to 2020, along with predictions for 2030 and 2040. However, while the response mentions key data points, it lacks specific numerical details that would enhance the analysis. The statement about Malaysia having the highest urban population is accurate, but the comparison with Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand could be more explicitly detailed. Overall, the response captures the essence of the task but could benefit from more precise data references and a clearer summary of trends.

Coherence and Cohesion: 6.0
The structure of the response is generally logical, with a clear progression from past data to future predictions. However, the use of cohesive devices is somewhat limited, and transitions between ideas could be smoother. Phrases like "In 1970s" and "After 50 years development" could be better integrated into the flow of the text. The candidate uses paragraphs effectively, but clearer signposting would improve the overall coherence of the response.

Lexical Resource: 6.5
The vocabulary used is appropriate for the task, with terms like "urban citizens," "population," and "predictions" effectively conveying the intended meaning. However, there are instances of awkward phrasing, such as "under one fifth of total number" and "little bit higher," which detract from the overall quality. The candidate demonstrates a reasonable range of vocabulary but could enhance their lexical resource by incorporating more varied expressions and avoiding repetition.

Grammatical Range and Accuracy: 6.0
The response includes a mix of simple and complex sentences, demonstrating a fair range of grammatical structures. However, there are several grammatical errors, such as "the population in all four countries have increased more or few" (should be "more or less") and "the data are little bit higher" (should be "a little bit higher"). These errors affect clarity and accuracy. Punctuation is generally correct, but some sentences could be restructured for better grammatical precision.

Overall Remarks:
The response effectively summarizes the trends in urban population growth in four Asian nations, providing a clear overview of the data presented in the line graph. While it captures the main points, the analysis would benefit from more specific numerical references, improved cohesion, and greater grammatical accuracy. The overall grade reflects these strengths and areas for improvement.

Overall Grade: 6.0

_The line graph illustrates the percentage of urban residents in four Asian nations from 1970 to 2020, with projections for 2030 and 2040._

_Overall, the urban population has increased in all four countries compared to 50 years ago, and this upward trend is expected to continue for at least the next 20 years._

_In the 1970s, the proportion of urban dwellers in Thailand and Indonesia was less than one-fifth of the total population, slightly higher in the Philippines and Malaysia at around 30%. Over the 50-year period, Malaysia's urban population surged to over 80%, the highest among the four countries. Indonesia, initially the lowest, experienced rapid growth and surpassed the Philippines and Thailand after 2010._

_Looking ahead, the percentage of urban residents is projected to keep rising after 2020, with Malaysia maintaining its leading position. By 2040, the urban population in all four nations is anticipated to exceed half of the total population._

## 观点（二选一）

__The most important aim of science should be to improve people's lives.__

__To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?__


_There is a statement claim that we should view improving people's lives as the most important aim of science. I strongly agree with it for three aspects in economy, ethical problem and feasibility._

_First of all, enonomy influences both our lives and science. Over last a hundred year, human society evoluted rapidly with the assistance of science, which brings a numerous amount of fortunes to all people in the world. As the result, with the substaintial money created with high productivity, scientist have a better condition for research, which can be help them to make a further step in science._

_Besides, ethical issues should be took into consideration. Science is a double sword, if we can not estimate the influence, it will bring disaster to human. As we all know, the initial usage of bomb is for road creating through mountains. Unfortunately, it becomes a killer in war with the abuse using, brings millions of death and sorrow for family. So we must keep 'improving human's lives' as the main aim of science._

_Some people may think we should develop science as fast as we can no matter what. However, take the one under control and keep the aim on benefiting human is a more feasible way. We can gather strength and motivation effectively under a clear direction, just like driving on the express way._

_In short, I believe the first and foremost aim of science is to benefit people. We should take science as an assistant for us rather than serving it. Science without people is nothing._


* Evaluation:

Task Achievement: 6.5 
The candidate strongly agrees with the statement regarding the importance of improving people's lives as the primary goal of science. The response addresses the three aspects of economy, ethical issues, and feasibility to support this viewpoint. The candidate effectively presents a clear position and develops ideas coherently and logically. Relevant examples and evidence are provided to strengthen the argument. However, some parts of the response could be more refined to fully answer the question and avoid repetition. While the conclusion is effective, a more comprehensive analysis of the statement's implications would enhance the score.

Coherence and Cohesion: 6.5 
The response is structured logically, with a clear introduction, body, and conclusion discussing the various aspects of the statement. Transition phrases like "First of all," "Besides," and "In short" help guide the reader through the argument. The paragraphs are well-organized, but some sentences could be more succinct for better cohesion. Maintaining the central theme and ensuring each paragraph has a clear topic sentence would strengthen coherence.


Lexical Resource: 6.0 
The vocabulary used is generally appropriate, with terms like "fortunes," "feasibility," and "substantial money" effectively conveying the candidate's ideas. However, there are instances of awkward phrasing ("evoluted rapidly") and grammatical errors that impact the lexical quality. More precise and accurate vocabulary choices could enhance the overall lexical resource, along with increased variety and idiomatic expressions.

Grammatical Range and Accuracy: 5.5 
The response includes a mix of simple and complex sentence structures, demonstrating an attempt at grammatical variety. However, there are several grammatical errors throughout the response, such as "enonomy" (economy), "substaintial" (substantial), and "be took" (be taken), affecting clarity and accuracy. Punctuation use is adequate, but improvements in sentence structure and grammatical precision are needed for a higher score.

Overall Remarks: 
The response effectively argues for considering the improvement of people's lives as the central aim of science, with supporting points related to economy, ethics, and feasibility. While the response is well-structured and coherent, there are areas for improvement in the clarity and accuracy of language use, as well as grammatical precision. Enhancing vocabulary range and addressing grammatical errors would elevate the overall quality of the response.

Overall Grade: 6.0

_There is a statement that we should view improving people's lives as the most important aim of science. I strongly agree with this for three reasons: economic impact, ethical considerations, and feasibility._

_First of all, the economy significantly influences both our lives and the field of science. Over the last hundred years, human society has evolved rapidly with the assistance of scientific advancements, generating substantial wealth for people worldwide. As a result, with the substantial financial resources created through high productivity, scientists have better conditions for research, enabling them to make further advancements in their fields._

_Furthermore, ethical issues must be taken into consideration. Science is a double-edged sword; if we cannot assess its consequences, it can lead to disastrous outcomes for humanity. For instance, the original purpose of explosives was to facilitate road construction through mountains. Unfortunately, these same explosives have been weaponized in warfare, leading to millions of deaths and immense sorrow for countless families. Therefore, we must prioritize "improving human lives" as the primary aim of science._

_Some may argue that we should advance science as rapidly as possible, regardless of the consequences. However, maintaining control and focusing on benefiting humanity is a more feasible approach. With a clear direction, we can effectively harness our collective strength and motivation, much like driving on a well-maintained expressway._

_In conclusion, I believe the foremost aim of science should be to benefit people. We should view science as an ally rather than something to be served. After all, science without humanity is meaningless._
