### table
__The table below shows how the UK unemployed spent their time last year.__

__Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.__

_The table illustrates the things unemployed spent time on last year in UK._

_Overall, people prefer handling stuff in morning rather than afternoon, such as doing housework, shopping and job hunting. Whatsmore, the choice is different in some fields by gender._

_On the one hand, 68% of unemployed intent to do housework in morning, much higher than that in the afternoon, with only 28%. Shopping is another similar circumstance, 20% declined in the afternoon compare with 46% on first half of day. However, there is a exception, both men and women tend to watch TV in the afternoon, with 10% increasing along the day._

_On the other hand, some arrangements are varied between men and women. 49% of women spent time on housework, while only 19% men interested in that. Opposite with housework, men showed more passion than women in gardening, 27% versus 5% in a whole day. At the same time, job hunting and sitting around have little difference in gender, separately within 6% and 3%._

* Evaluation:

Task Achievement: 6.0 The candidate addresses the general topic of how unemployed people in the UK spent their time last year, distinguishing between activities preferred in the morning versus the afternoon and differences between gender. However, the response lacks overall clarity in presenting precise data comparison. Some statistical details mentioned do not relate directly to the task's requirement to discuss the table effectively. The emphasis on time slots is appropriate, but a lack of clarity in summarizing and comparing critical data lowers the score.

Coherence and Cohesion: 6.5 The structure of the essay shows a basic logical flow, distinguishing between morning activities and gender differences. However, the transitions between ideas are sometimes abrupt, and the linking phrases like "Whatsmore" and "On the one hand" are used awkwardly. The use of paragraphs is clear, but better cohesion could be achieved by smoother transitions and a clearer linkage between the data presented and the tasks outlined in the table.

Lexical Resource: 6.0 The use of vocabulary is adequate with terms like "intent", "declined", and "varied" appropriately used. Some phrases and word choices are awkward or incorrect ("intent" should be "intend", "Whatsmore" is unconventional). There is a limited range of vocabulary to describe statistical data, and some repetition of words like "morning" and "afternoon" could be replaced with synonyms to enhance lexical range.

Grammatical Range and Accuracy: 5.5 The response includes a mix of complex and simple sentences. There are several grammatical errors ("68% of unemployed intent to do housework" should be "intend", "separately within 6% and 3%" is unclear and should be rephrased for clarity). These mistakes hinder the clarity and accuracy of the response. Punctuation is generally handled well, but sentence structure issues detract from the overall grammatical quality.

Overall Remarks:
The response provides a basic analysis of the table's data concerning unemployed peoples' time utilization in the UK, categorized by time of day and gender differences. Although it captures fundamental distinctions, it struggles with clarity in data presentation and accuracy in language use. The essay would benefit from fewer grammatical errors, a better range of vocabulary concerning data description, and improved logical sequencing of ideas for higher coherence. The overall grade reflects these areas of strength and needed improvements.

Overall Grade: 6.0

_The table illustrates how unemployed individuals in the UK spent their time last year. Overall, people tend to engage in activities more frequently in the morning than in the afternoon, such as housework, shopping, and job hunting. Furthermore, there are gender differences in activity preferences._

_On one hand, 68% of unemployed individuals prefer doing housework in the morning, a much higher percentage compared to the afternoon, which stands at only 28%. A similar pattern is observed for shopping, with a 20% decrease in the afternoon compared to 46% in the first half of the day. However, there is an exception as both men and women tend to watch TV more in the afternoon, with a 10% increase as the day progresses._

_On the other hand, there are variations in activity choices between men and women. For instance, 49% of women spend time on housework, whereas only 19% of men are interested in this activity. In contrast, men show a greater interest in gardening compared to women, with 27% versus 5% spending time on this activity throughout the day. Additionally, there is little difference in gender when it comes to job hunting and leisure time, with only a 6% and 3% variance, respectively._

Additionally, the mention of same-sex marriage in Canada is relevant but could be better integrated into the overall analysis. Overall, the response is focused on the topic but could benefit from a more thorough exploration of the data.

Coherence and Cohesion: 6.0
The organization of ideas is generally logical, but the flow could be improved with clearer transitions between points. The use of cohesive devices is present but somewhat limited, leading to occasional abrupt shifts in topic. Paragraphing is not effectively utilized, as the response reads more like a continuous block of text rather than distinct sections. Each point could benefit from clearer topic sentences to guide the reader through the analysis. While the central theme is maintained, the lack of signposting language and varied sentence structures detracts from the overall coherence. More careful sequencing of ideas would enhance the clarity of the argument.

Lexical Resource: 6.5
The vocabulary used is appropriate, and there is a reasonable range of terms related to marital status. However, some phrases are repetitive, and the response could benefit from a broader use of synonyms to avoid redundancy. The candidate demonstrates an understanding of academic vocabulary, but there are instances where word choices could be more precise or varied. Although the language is generally clear, there are moments where idiomatic expressions or more sophisticated terms could enhance the overall quality. The spelling is mostly accurate, but the occasional awkward phrasing detracts from the overall impression.

Grammatical Range and Accuracy: 6.0
The grammatical structures used in the response are mostly correct, with a mix of simple and complex sentences. However, there are a few grammatical errors, such as subject-verb agreement and punctuation issues, that affect the overall clarity. The candidate demonstrates an understanding of verb tenses, but there are instances of awkward phrasing that suggest a lack of fluency in more complex structures.

## 观点（二选一）

__The most important aim of science should be to improve people's lives.__

__To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?__


_There is a statement claim that we should view improving people's lives as the most important aim of science. I strongly agree with it for three aspects in economy, ethical problem and feasibility._

_First of all, enonomy influences both our lives and science. Over last a hundred year, human society evoluted rapidly with the assistance of science, which brings a numerous amount of fortunes to all people in the world. As the result, with the substaintial money created with high productivity, scientist have a better condition for research, which can be help them to make a further step in science._

_Besides, ethical issues should be took into consideration. Science is a double sword, if we can not estimate the influence, it will bring disaster to human. As we all know, the initial usage of bomb is for road creating through mountains. Unfortunately, it becomes a killer in war with the abuse using, brings millions of death and sorrow for family. So we must keep 'improving human's lives' as the main aim of science._

_Some people may think we should develop science as fast as we can no matter what. However, take the one under control and keep the aim on benefiting human is a more feasible way. We can gather strength and motivation effectively under a clear direction, just like driving on the express way._

_In short, I believe the first and foremost aim of science is to benefit people. We should take science as an assistant for us rather than serving it. Science without people is nothing._

_There is a statement that we should view improving people's lives as the most important aim of science. I strongly agree with this for three reasons: economic impact, ethical considerations, and feasibility._

_First of all, the economy significantly influences both our lives and the field of science. Over the last hundred years, human society has evolved rapidly with the assistance of scientific advancements, generating substantial wealth for people worldwide. As a result, with the substantial financial resources created through high productivity, scientists have better conditions for research, enabling them to make further advancements in their fields._

_Furthermore, ethical issues must be taken into consideration. Science is a double-edged sword; if we cannot assess its consequences, it can lead to disastrous outcomes for humanity. For instance, the original purpose of explosives was to facilitate road construction through mountains. Unfortunately, these same explosives have been weaponized in warfare, leading to millions of deaths and immense sorrow for countless families. Therefore, we must prioritize "improving human lives" as the primary aim of science._

_Some may argue that we should advance science as rapidly as possible, regardless of the consequences. However, maintaining control and focusing on benefiting humanity is a more feasible approach. With a clear direction, we can effectively harness our collective strength and motivation, much like driving on a well-maintained expressway._

_In conclusion, I believe the foremost aim of science should be to benefit people. We should view science as an ally rather than something to be served. After all, science without humanity is meaningless._
